561844982154318,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/561844982154318/,,"I posted on here about 5 weeks ago that my 6 month old (3rd child) was waking me every 45-90 min at night! I tried everything! Then I joined this group and found a post by a sleep trainer from Sleep Wise Consulting named Erika saying she would give a free 15min consult… I thought it was a long shot because my child is so stubborn - but I’m so desperate I’ll try. We did the 15min chat and I signed up a bit nervous about the process and praying it would work.
I received a day for my first session and a questionnaire which I needed to fill in. Then Erika asked to see a video of the room (oh did I mention she is on the other side of the world to me!).
She took that questionnaire and video and created a sleep training plan that suited me and my family. We got started that night! By day four I was thinking “my child won’t sleep train she’s too head strong and stubborn and this is just my life now”. But Erika was so helpful and encouraging and she told me to just stick to it, that she would help me make it work, staying with me on text messages all night long taking me through it step by step!

Loooooong story short… my baby slept through on day 7!!!!! I mean for the first time in her life! She slept from 7pm until 6am!!!! She is still sleeping through except for two days when she had one wake up in the night but I’m putting it down to teething. After that she was back to sleeping 11 hours again! This has honestly changed my life! I suffered through 22 months of no sleep with my first child and by this one I thought I knew what I was doing - but you get so tired and bad habits are formed out of desperation to get the little one to sleep and before you know it it’s out of control! I so wish I hadn’t waited 6.5 months to get a sleep trainer!! It’s so wonderful to have someone talk you through each wake up at night and support you so you know you are doing the right thing. It’s easy to doubt yourself at 2am when you’ve been in and out of the room 4 times and she’s still crying! No way I could have done that with just an app or online “sleep training” DIY.

Thank you Erika Simon and Sleep Wise Consulting! You have changed my life and I am soooooo grateful!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️","06/18/2022, 00:54:26"

I think sleep and eating in night depends on their age and weight. I’m told the bigger they get the more they can eat at a time and the longer they sleep. So ￼ In the beginning when their tummies are really tiny they can eat small amounts at a time which means that they can only go so long without food which means frequent feeding and waking periods at the night but it does get easier￼,"06/18/2022, 00:00:00"
