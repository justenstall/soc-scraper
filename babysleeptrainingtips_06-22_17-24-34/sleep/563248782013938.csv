please don’t think i’m crazy 😂 i feel like my 3 month old isn’t getting as much sleep as he needs. he normally naps maybe twice a day for 1-3 hours. he normally sleeps a good 6-8 hours at night. but his wake windows during the day are crazy (i’m talking like 3 hours and up). my in-laws say there’s nothing to worry about because he’s a “bigger baby”. i’m just wondering if this is something i need to work on or not even worry about. i feel awful because he gets so exhausted sometimes and i can’t help him sleep if he refuses to.

also: i don’t swaddle him due to the fact he rolls over in the middle of the night

here’s a picture of my chunky man so hopefully somebody will see this and help ease my first time parenting nerves.","06/20/2022, 00:41:00"

Will just make your life difficult If your trying to put hum down for a nap and he's not tired

Don't worry about him being chunky my baby is the same!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I could see changes in her as she grew and turns out around 4 months their sleep patterns change and align more with adults apparently.

I would try and follow a 3 nap schedule for his age if possible.

He should be getting about 4.5 hours sleep for his age on average give or take. Don’t let him sleep more then 2 hours at a time so that he has enough sleep pressure for his next nap!
Try and get him down to sleep during biological sleep windows (easier to fall
Asleep and stay asleep during these times) so between 9-10 12-2 and 6-7 I think is the last one! This is why the arvo nap is hard as it’s not when a biological sleep window is! This nap is great to have as full contact nap or carrier/car naps if your baby is resisting often.

At the moment my baby roughly does this schedule! Sometimes won’t link cycles however so I finish the nap either in my carrier or on me.

Pending on his AM wake up and wake windows! You would need to adjust this but roughly this is his schedule.

Wake 7. Feed/play
Sleep again about 8:45-10. Feed half side at 10 play then feed other side at 11. Sleep 11:45-2. Feed and play again.
Sleep 3:45-5. Feed half, play, bath, feed other half bed at 6:30 (15 minute shorter awake window at night times)

Then I do a dream feed at 10:30 then he wakes at 3 for feed and back to sleep again until 7ish.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
