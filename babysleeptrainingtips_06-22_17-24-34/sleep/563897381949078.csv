563897381949078,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/563897381949078/,,"My baby is 2 months old. She mostly breastfeeds to sleep. Sometimes I can get dad to give her a bottle then rock her to bed, but it’s rare. I usually just give up and breastfeed her until she falls asleep. She does not take a paci and I tried a soother and she takes it at times, but then remembers that’s not a nipple and starts rejecting it. Every time she wakes up I try to pad her and sooth her in the bassinet, but it doesn’t help as she starts crying for me to pick her up and breastfeed her again to sleep. Also, she does not like swaddles. I have tried sleep sacks as Love Me and Zen zack and she doesn’t like them. She usually sleeps 4-5 hours then wakes up I BF again then sleeps for 2 more hours. What can I do start teaching her to sleep without BF, swaddled and paci? I feel like sometimes she is overeating and gets gassy. I have even coslept because I literally have even fallen asleep.

Also, what they mean when they try to dig their head like this?","06/21/2022, 00:50:44"

We also figured out that every time the AC would kick on, she would freak out and wake up because the vent was blowing directly at her pack and play, so we started putting extra layers on her, and she sleeps so much better, she must not like the cold. We thought she hated swaddles too, turns out they weren’t tight enough, she loves to be swaddled the way they do in the hospital, with just some receiving blankets, we double them and swaddle her twice. The only other swaddle she will sleep with is the love to dream arms up one. And we keep her hatch on the red light with washing machine sounds, anything else is too stimulating for her. We look for sleep cues and put her to bed awake, if we wait to long and she falls asleep on us, she wakes up when moving her screaming, and if we put her down too soon, she’s screaming. We wait until her eyes become heavy, and she starts yawning with the red eyebrows. She is also our hiccup and gassy girl, so gripe water has been a godsend and she usually gets between .5-1 ml after every feed. Text me and I can show you how we swaddle her, I had to teach Charlee and Jared and now they are both pros lol","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

Tbh the best way of figuring it out is different routines and different methods but all baby’s are different . Noise though was a big help always have lots of noise so they sleep through anything don’t get them use to the quiet . Alot of times after a while of so much noise it becomes a comfort .

The feeling-reflex of being full and satisfied with food is best at babies... unfortunately it dulls as the baby grows and that's why adults do not often knows their eating limits and overeat....and that's why there is obesity. So do not worry she knows how much to eat. Her stomach is still very small so she need to eat more often it will take few months to sleep through the night but it will come 💞,"06/21/2022, 21:24:47"

564070201931796,https://facebook.com/564070201931796,563897381949078,"I think she is probably “rooting” on your husband there. Babies this age have a reflex to find the breast when they feel something against their cheek. Our baby does the same thing to anybody that hold her that way. As for the wake ups, sleeping 4-5 hrs is so great for 2 months and she needs to be fed after that long stretch. Our baby sleeps in similar chunks at night and I breastfeed her when she wakes then she falls asleep on the boob again once she’s full. It works out great because I just put her back in her bassinet, completely full, and she goes back to sleep for another 4 hr chunk","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
563918395280310,https://facebook.com/563918395280310,563897381949078,"This is very common with babies this age! Try not to stress it too much…every thing will work out. I would say just start on good sleep habits now..example: feed her (bottle or breast) then read her a story THEN put her to bed..so she’s not associating the milk with bedtime. If she is gassy you can do the “bicycle legs” 5-10 minutes every diaper change and right before bed, gripe water, and making sure she gets a good burp out after each feeding! I had my baby in bed with me for a while after we came home from the hospital and it worked well for us, if you are comfortable with that! There are ways you can safely share a bed with a baby. Just make sure there are no pillows or blankets super close to the baby, and make sure your house temp is set at a good temperature (68-70 degrees)..altho
ugh I do heat that cooler temperatures are better for safe sleeping. Babies that young don’t move much while sleeping so you don’t have to worry about her rolling over on her tummy or into a blanket/pillow for a while.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

My 6 month old only give me 3 hour stretches. She still needs to eat through the night. She is so little and they digest everything so quickly that she is actually hungry. Keep feeding her mama.

on being a great attentive mama 😉) would be to suggest a schedule/
routine so that both of you are not worn out with feeds AND begin putting her down before she is rooting and showing signs of exhaustion. We sometimes think that patting(this is kinds fast here too) will help but it often overstimulates and then they get in a cycle of not being able to calm/sleep. Create a calm place for her to go down, do a schedule and tey to put her down before ages exhausted. I promise it will help every single time. Getting her sleep set for the day will set it at night. 💕

When I tried to at 2 months she was really crying with the routine, so I stopped it. A month later she started to sleep by herself 4hours plus, and here we are about to be 2 months of her sleeping herself. My point is, they do their own routine in my opinion, nobody likes to get forced to sleep. Doctors even told me when she wants to sleep she will sleep. And I’m glad I listened.

We have tried everything and my baby is 5 months. She rejected a pacifier up until she was 4 months old and now finally takes the itzy ritzy ones. I would just say try to have a pretty strict routine and she will most likely learn that it’s time for bed and get used to whatever you do. You may want to try maybe feeding her a bottle before bed and have that only for bed so she knows that is it and then sleep.

I fed her every 2.5 hrs and most of the time her caloric needs were then met during the day.

At this age it's not recommended to do any kind of sleep training and to do everything on demand until 6 months. After that you can start giving he other ways to cope like butt tapping, rubbing back, playing with hair etc. Once your little is good with that move to a crib at naps because that is when you are the most awake and then at night once your little is good with the crib at naps. You'll also want to play in your littles room and rock them or do bedtime routine in their room until it's time to sleep so your baby is used to their room when it's time to start putting them in their crib. When your baby is a bot older you can even do tummy time in the crib so they are used to the crib as well","06/22/2022, 09:24:47"

Doesn’t like to be swaddle, doesn’t like paci, and only sleeps if I’m next to him or he’s on me. The only way my husband and I have been getting sleep is if we cosleep and honestly I don’t mind it, I want to be able to spend as much time with my baby before he’s not a baby anymore 🥺 he is also being breastfed and uses me as a pacifier. I’ve also noticed that he falls asleep in the car in his car seat. I’ve been reading that there’s no wrong way of doing things as long as baby is healthy and safe which has helped me a lot these past two months. I also saw how moms use their breast pads to put next to baby when sleeping so baby and have moms scent. Being a parent is hard especially when breastfeeding but I enjoy being with baby every second of it. We got this 💪🏼","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I also heard to put a heating pad where you’re gonna lay them and then move it before you lay them down so it’s warm. Maybe even put your shirt under the pad so it’s warm and smells like you when they go to lay down. Or just co sleep if you’re comfortable w that lol.

Also, she may be waking in the night because she is hungry which again is really normal at this age. You could try instead doing a ‘dream feed’ when you’re ready to go bed, and she may then not wake for the middle of the night Feed.

It’s about sleep training and how to go about it the most effective way. We did do some simple training at the start. Such as just having a routine.

Here is a photo of the book. My fellow mom friend used this technique with her kids and they slept through the night by 10wks.

Hope this helps 🙃","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
