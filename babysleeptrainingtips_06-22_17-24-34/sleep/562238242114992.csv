564298178575665,https://facebook.com/564298178575665,562238242114992,"Many safe sleep experts have expressed concern about the potential for a baby to overheat while sleeping in the Magic Sleepsuit. Even Merlin suggests “monitoring” the baby in the sleepsuit, emphasizing on their website that it's the responsibility of the parent or caregiver to ensure that the baby does not overheat. I think it is not very safe","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

Mostly either wore it with a short sleeve onesie or just his diaper. Our current 4 month old girl hates it. I randomly tried everything and in the end she loved a weighted sleep sack... even then, she’s not totally on board with it completely.","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

We’re still working on that wake up time. The first night our LO woke up around 11pm screaming but was rocked back to sleep quickly. We haven’t heard a peep from her at night since then.
