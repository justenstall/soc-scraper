I follow a sleep schedule making sure his naps are not too long but he has the right amount of awake windows. I make sure he eats enough through the day and also that when he is awake I interact with him. But he won't settle for his night sleep until 11pm and wakes every time we place him down in his basket until 11pm. Then he wakes up at 2am and again at 4am. He also wakes full at 7am. I'm so tired and don't know what more I can do. I have my tops that smell like me with him when he sleeps ans he is swaddled he won't sleep without the swaddle at night. I am at a loss. Picture of my little one is here,"06/22/2022, 03:57:47"

For some reason it helped with a longer stretch of sleep I found getting a 30minutes nap in before bedtime routine helped to stop the extended period of fussiness at night.

My boy has only started sleeping through the night for past month or so and he turned 6 months on 15th. Just keep up with a routine but an earlier bedtime, 7/8pm would be best so he might do a longer stretch, feed him 3 hours during day. Bath, clothed, massage if you want, bottle, take to where he is sleeping in the dark, white noise and he will get to know it's gonna be bedtime soon. Good luck mama 😘","06/22/2022, 08:25:07"

Try to get him to bed earlier (around 8pm) by introducing a regular unwinding bed time routine. We do bottle, stories and cuddles for 30mins before bed and it really helped my 4mth old settle into his first block of sleep which now goes for anywhere from 5 - 7 hours","06/22/2022, 07:25:07"

564864601852356,https://facebook.com/564864601852356,564629861875830,Totally normal... my daughter had the odd night she slept through but she didn't sleep through until she was 7 months old. No sleep training or anything like that. She was just ready at that point and didn't need any feeds in the night. All babies are different. I know people with toddlers who don't sleep through. Don't worry and try and sleep in the day to catch up on sleep or ask someone to look after baby while you go for a sleep or get partner to get up with baby and you have a lay in 🙂 it does pass. Doesn't feel like it at the time but honestly they are still so young,"06/22/2022, 12:25:07"
564739761864840,https://facebook.com/564739761864840,564629861875830,Personally I found that waking my baby through the day caused her to habitually sleep in short stretches. I used to follow a schedule and when it wasn't working I did away with it and started watching for her cues and things were a bit better. If you breast feed also your baby is probably just digesting quickly. If it's possible to feed him more before bed I would try that too. My little girl is 4 months and won't stay asleep until after 11 also.,"06/22/2022, 08:25:07"

If you’ve got them on a schedule that works for you both, and watch their cues that is all you can really do.

I’m not entirely sure why she wakes up at 2am but around 4am is when she wakes up to eat and I’ll usually warm up the bottle and that keeps her asleep until about 6am-7am.
