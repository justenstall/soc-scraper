He has a set schedule and I do wait it out to see if he just crying a little bit or making noises but he is hungry and wants to eat. Did anyone gave them cereal early and it made them sleep longer or is that just a myth. Pictures so we don't get lost
Update: I'm not trying to give him cereal so I could sleep longer I mean yeah that'll be great but it's mostly so I can go back to work. I work 430am and I definitely can't do it if I'm only going to get 3 hours of sleep 😂","06/19/2022, 21:01:34"

As some have already mentioned, more food doesn't necessarily mean baby will sleep longer. He's growing and developing super fast and he needs you and those nutrients.
You're right, you need your rest to go back to work. I remember nodding off a lot during evening feedings in those early days but I miss those days sooo much! It gets a little easier but they go through so many developmental stages and changes that sleep and being well rested is a thing of the past.

Having a baby means sleep deprivation for most parents. Your baby is growing and must eat every 2-3 hours. Some pediatricians actually say the baby should be woken up if they don’t wake up after 4 hours to eat. Also, be ready that things can get worse. At around 4-6 months my baby started sleeping in 3-4 hours chunks and after 7 months it all changes and he started waking up every 1-2 hours. He’s 9 months now and still wakes up sometimes every time I put him in the crib. I get about 2-3 times of 1-2 hours of sleep and it sucks, you need to find a solution with the way things are without jeopardizing your babies health. Good luck!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
