My 6 months old Goes to bed at around 9 and sleeps until 5/6. He wakes Up hungry one or twice a night and then Goes Back to sleep quite fast ..so that is OK for me and for now i am happy with His sleeping pattern.
The Thing is that in the morning He never wakes Up without crying. For about an hour before waking Up He moves a Lot and Starts crying and screaming, then sleeps again for a few minutes, then cries again. At First i thought IT might be Gas Bit as soon aß He wakes Up He is normally all smiles...
Does anyone experience the Same ? What could IT BE? Is He dreaming? I try changing His Position, cuddling hin, talking to hin Bit He seems unresponsive.","06/01/2022, 02:40:03"

Took me awhile to figure out for my daughter. Now she wakes up without crying. It's such a relief,"06/01/2022, 17:40:03"

She don't do this all the time but I can tell by the cry it's bad dreams.

She cried when she got tired and when she woke up in the middle of the night and when she woke in the morning. Never when she got up from naps in the middle of the day. Now, she is almost 9 months and for the last month she has woke up every single time with a huge smile on her face. I honestly think it was just her still getting used to the world and how she feels in it. Getting put to a deep sleep and waking up from it must be traumatic for a little baby. Hang in there. If there is an appointment coming up, for sure mention it, but if you don’t see signs of something possibly wrong during the day and this is a cycle, hang in there and give him a little more time to adjust to this routine.","06/01/2022, 17:40:03"

Keep up the good work mama and teething can also be happening. Maybe get some stuff to rub on his gums and some Tylenol. 💙","06/01/2022, 17:40:03"
