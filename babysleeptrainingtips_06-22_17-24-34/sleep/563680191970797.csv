563860171952799,https://facebook.com/563860171952799,563680191970797,Thank you everyone! I was so curious because it’s literally a new thing… she was grunting a lot in her sleep when she was a newborn and then she grew out of it and she’s doing it again but only when she’s trying to fall asleep and it makes her take a very long time to soothe and sleep lol I thought she was in pain or something so I always pick her up from her crib and definitely sometimes she burps right after!,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

563768935295256,https://facebook.com/563768935295256,563680191970797,I’ve researched this and it can either be assisted digestion since their system is so immature. They grunt to develop a bowel movement since they don’t know how to relax the muscles in the bum quite yet. Could also be a need to burp or pass gas.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
564146298590853,https://facebook.com/564146298590853,563680191970797,Mine does. Especially 3-7am when she’s in active sleep or going back to sleep. Sometimes it gets excessive and I think it’s from gas (calms down once she toots) but overall I think it’s just normal noises for them to explore,"06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
