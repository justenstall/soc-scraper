I had my sons 2 month appt today. He is in the 10 percentile with his weight weighing 10 lbs 10 oz. I told her he sleeps for like 5-7 hrs at night and she advised me to wake him every 3 hrs to eat. When hes 3 months then he can sleep 4-5 hrs a night.

What are your thoughts?","06/06/2022, 20:17:36"

With my first, the pediatricians gave us no end of trouble over weight gain. She was born early, 7th percentile, slid down to 3rd, then moved up a percentile or two little by little. She had pumped breastmilk so we knew she was taking in a lot for her size. She was probably close to 2 when she stayed at 50 or above. It's a percentile. There will be babies on both ends. If your baby's growth is steady and he's waking up hungry (never lethargic) he should be fine. He should want lots of milk during the times he eats.","06/08/2022, 17:38:01"

Honestly, I dpn't really follow the percentile thing, unless there is a hudge drop which eould be concerning.

Babies come in every sizes, like us, and I don't think it matters if your baby is small/big/
medium or oversized..

I ignored what she said and let him sleep through the night and listened to my mother in law and now at 2 months his weight is perfect and hes in the percentile he should be in! Every baby is different and they base everything off an average of what babies do and should do! Just like milestones every baby hits them at different moments depending on the baby! We love our pediatrician but we agreed to listen to our mother in law and our son is perfectly healthy and fine and sleeps through the night. Thats just my opinion and from the experience I have learned from! I also woke my son up 1 night to feed like she said and he wouldn't eat for anything and was up all night afterwards screaming because I woke him up if the baby wants to sleep let the baby sleep!
