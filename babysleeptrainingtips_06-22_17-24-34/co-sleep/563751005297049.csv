563751005297049,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/563751005297049/,,"Photo from today of another failed attempt to get him to sleep in his crib 🥲 (I don’t leave him unattended to sleep with anything in his crib) he’s 5 weeks and 4 days old (I know no schedule to be had or training just yet) but how do you get your baby to enjoy their crib? I was in a bad habit of cosleeping just so I could get any sort of rest as I’m breastfeeding. Recently I’ve been trying to break this habit so that he can sleep better and safer on his own. It seems to not matter if he’s in a swing, in his crib, bassinet, anything. He can be dead asleep and as soon as I put him down he’s fussing, the paci is won’t help but sometimes patting does but as soon as I stop he’s fussing again. Since birth he’s been able to roll from his back to his belly and is able to roll from his belly to back now and has great head control so during naps I allow him to sleep on his stomach (never unattended) but now he will not sleep on his back. I’ve tried white noise and I always have a fan on. He hates to be swaddled and will scream until he is out of it 😭. I really want to stop cosleeping I had one night where he slept 5 hours in his crib (10:30pm to 3:30am and his pediatrician said it’s okay for him to sleep longer stretches) since then he will not let me put him in his crib to sleep.","06/20/2022, 19:25:59"

He's now 9 weeks and follows the same pattern every night - down at around 8/9pm, sleeps till 1/2am then down again for 2 hours, wakes for a feed, then another 2 hours and then he's up for the morning till nap time at around 11am-ish, though sometimes he skips this one and goes straight through till about 4pm. I promise it does get better! We're already seeing a huge change, and hoping soon he might drop the second night feed and go through from 2am to morning 🤞","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

I never move during the night, keep her close to me and on her back, and keep myself between her and my husband. If we didn't co sleep I'd have lost my mind. 😬 it just takes time for them go adjust... every baby is different. Be kind to yourself you're doing great!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
564309925241157,https://facebook.com/564309925241157,563751005297049,"If he can roll over and has good head control, maybe let him sleep on his tummy? My little one was the same. Went on till she was 2 months then I finally gave in and put her on her tummy and she slept for 6 hours. She 5 months now and sleeps for 9 hours. She switches from her front to her side now.

The first night is scary, I hardly slept 😅 but once the first night is done and I knew she had slept and was no longer fussy or grumpy in the day, I managed to sleep the next night with no worries.

I find health visitors purposely try to scare us into making our babies sleep on there backs, when the is no proven cause for SIDS, it still happens to babies who sleep on there backs, sides, swaddled. My mum was told to put me on my tummy and my nan was told to swaddle and put baby on there side. No doubt I'll all change again in the next 10 years.

Every baby is different, you've just got to find what suits your baby best 🥰

Your doing great mamma and baby is a beautie! 🥰🥰","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

I read that the cry it out method can only cause anxiety, and the best thing to do is to let them cry it out no more than 5 minutes before picking them back up and coaxing him back to sleep. If he wakes up when you try to put him down, repeat and eventually he will wear himself out fighting without hurting his vocals or feeling isolated after being so used to co sleeping. I didn’t learn this until a little later, my son is 6 months old now and I still most of the time have to put him to sleep myself. But he is learning to self soothe bit by bit! He would never take a pacifier and prefers I pat his back gently as he falls asleep! Keeping soothing lavender scented things around is a good way to help them sleep peacefully but I was told never to apply anything scented to their skin. And you can find baby soothe lavender spray at Walmart! I’m told Hello Bello is the best one to use!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

It’s helped us transition him and the pillow to the crib and he’s been sleeping in the crib for about 2 months now, we transitioned when we were able to let him sleep through the night. He’ll be 5 months next week. And we’re planning on getting the bigger size for him when he outgrows this one, he loves them!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I came across a free sleep seminar when my son was around that age and it helped us out huge! They're actually hosting another one soon.
