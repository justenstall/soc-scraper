I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it. They will let you know when they are ready to do things on their own. They need and want you especially this young.","06/22/2022, 11:05:44"
564850698520413,https://facebook.com/564850698520413,I would feed her so she can go to sleep and relax. Let her have a good nap and once she‚Äôs up keep track of her wake period and try and get her down 20 minutes before the end of the period. At this age sometimes they need that comfort to sleep not all the time but sometimes they need a snuggle! It doesn‚Äôt create a bad habit,"06/22/2022, 11:02:44"
564852218520261,https://facebook.com/564852218520261,"Like others have said, 11 weeks is too young. They don‚Äôt have the capacity to try and ‚Äúself soothe‚Äù. Wait until closer to 6 months. For now, rock/feed/
cuddle do whatever your baby needs. I‚Äôm there rn and it‚Äôs hard, just have to power through. We were up for almost 3 hours last night bc my girl was overtired and wouldn‚Äôt sleep. Im exhausted, but just need to get through. I don‚Äôt have much help rn either. Cosleep, feed to sleep, do whatever you need to do to get some rest. I have my girl napping on me and we are about to go cuddle in my bed bc my body is so weak from the lack of sleep.","06/22/2022, 11:05:44"
564850178520465,https://facebook.com/564850178520465,Stop letting that poor baby cry. Baby is too young for the cry it out method. Baby is crying for so long because she is feeling abandoned. Hold her cuddle her. Being a mom to a young baby means less sleep for mom. It is a sacrifice. Try laying down next to her until shes in a deep sleep. She spent 9 months being cuddled in your belly and 11 weeks is too soon to be ok without you. Please. Please don't let her cry.,"06/22/2022, 11:08:44"

564854928519990,https://facebook.com/564854928519990,"Honestly... a baby that age wants you. All they know is you. They want your comfort. But baby in a wrap. My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller. The fresh air does wonders. Best of luck ‚ù§Ô∏è the first like 4 months is very very hard for sleep. Just love on her as much as you can ‚ù§Ô∏è you're doing amazing!","06/22/2022, 11:10:44"

Teaches them to self soothe IN the crib so when they wake up after a sleep cycle they'll be right where they fell asleep. If you put her down ""drowsy"" with slow blinks or eyes rolling it's already light sleep! We hired a sleep consultant that coached us through and best money ever spent.","06/22/2022, 11:20:44"

Even Richard Ferber, who gave the name to the sleep training method, says that he recommends starting to sleep train not earlier than 4-5 months.
Hang in there and give your baby all the love and tender she needs at the moment, sleep training is for later. ü§ó","06/22/2022, 11:25:44"

564845201854296,https://facebook.com/564845201854296,"Personally I am not against the Ferber method. But I think she is WAY too young to try. Especially letting the crying go for 2 hours. I know everyone is against it, but I co-sleep and ever since I‚Äôve started not only was it way easier with breast feeding, I was also getting WAY more sleep as well. Good luck!","06/22/2022, 10:59:44"
564848141854002,https://facebook.com/564848141854002,"It‚Äôs too early for the Ferber method, experts say they are developmentally
ready around 4 or 5 months. I would try the pick up put down method. When she cries pick her up calm her down and wait about 30-40 seconds before putting her back in the crib. Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested. So sorry mama! It‚Äôs hard hearing your baby cry sending love and support. ‚ù§Ô∏è","06/22/2022, 10:59:44"

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an option for you but you‚Äôll get some much needed sleep. I tried the ‚Äúgentle cry it out‚Äù method checking on him every 10 minutes, rubbing his head or patting his belly/back every check without picking him up. After 2 weeks of no success with that I learned that babies get a boost of energy past 9oclock. I do ‚Äúbath, book, breast, bed‚Äù I have to rock him for about 20-30 minutes and gently put him in his crib. He‚Äôs been doing good with that for 2 months and I don‚Äôt see him until the next morning. If he does wake he cries for about 5-10 minutes but I let him get comfortable about and he puts himself about to sleep.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up. I know this because he spends an hour playing with himself and then he begins to make some sounds.","06/22/2022, 11:06:44"
