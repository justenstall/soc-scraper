I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it.

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller.

Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

564520211886795,https://facebook.com/564520211886795,"Hi all, just curious when you sleep trained or transitioned your child, did you go from bassinet to crib and also sleep trained, or did you do one change at a time. My son is almost 5 months old and we have always coslept and contact
Naps, so him being alone in his bassinet is a big change in itself, I‚Äôm wondering do i just make the switch to the crib now‚Ä¶will i have to sleep train twice if the environment is slightly different. I will still have his noise machine etc. He‚Äôs a sensitive baby and he‚Äôs refusing naps and waking frequently at night now, so seems like nows the time to sleep train.","06/21/2022, 23:59:51"
564840355188114,https://facebook.com/564840355188114,My baby girl was the same and I didn't feel safe with her in my bed so wen she was 5 weeks I got a co sleeper bassinet that attached to my bed then we she got to big for it we started using her cot missing one side attached to my side of the bed so she can see me and smell me still and since she was 2 months old she has been sleeping all night . Now at 7 months old I'm still doing it and she sleeps 12.5 hours straight. It's worth a shot,"06/22/2022, 10:59:51"

564581968547286,https://facebook.com/564581968547286,"I co slept with my first born until he was about 4.5 months I sleep trained him using the pause/ cry it out method in his own room in his cot and he eventually slept through the night. Then he had his 8 month sleep regression and would only sleep about 4 hours then wouldn‚Äôt fo back in his cot. I got our spare mattress and put it on the floor in his room and when he woke I‚Äôd lay with him on there until he fell asleep then I‚Äôd go back to my room and he‚Äôd sleep for the rest of the night. After a little while of this we ditched the cot all together and just put him straight on the mattress at bedtime and he would go straight to sleep on his own. He‚Äôs now 18 months old and goes to bed at 7pm, I lay him on the mattress in his sleeping bag and he goes straight to sleep and sleeps through the night. Has been like this from about 10 months. It‚Äôs not for everyone but that‚Äôs just what worked for us.","06/22/2022, 02:59:51"

564533768552106,https://facebook.com/564533768552106,"Girl! First, your doing amazing! Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets ü§£.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 00:59:51"

I haven‚Äôt had this issue with my guy (7 months on Monday!), but he is in his own room. It was what worked best for us. However, I do still get the screaming baby when I try to lay him down too early. I give him 15 more minutes of play time and try again. But likely won‚Äôt work for your situation if it‚Äôs a sleep association thing instead.

Also, is this just a night time thing, or any time he sleeps?","06/21/2022, 23:59:52"
