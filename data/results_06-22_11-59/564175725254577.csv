I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it.

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller.

Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

Naps, so him being alone in his bassinet is a big change in itself, I‚Äôm wondering do i just make the switch to the crib now‚Ä¶will i have to sleep train twice if the environment is slightly different. I will still have his noise machine etc. He‚Äôs a sensitive baby and he‚Äôs refusing naps and waking frequently at night now, so seems like nows the time to sleep train.","06/21/2022, 23:59:51"

Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets ü§£.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 00:59:51"

She sleeps from 6pm-12am, feed and change, then from 12:45am-7am. Which doc said was fine but not to go over 6 hours at her 4 week appointment. The other day she had a bit longer day than usual and I haven‚Äôt been setting an alarm to feed because she‚Äôs great at letting me know. Well she slept through the night and because I was exhausted so did I. I‚Äôm talking 8 1/2 hours! I woke up panicked but she was just fine and woke up about 15 minutes later and drank a whole 6 ounces. I thought it was a fluke but she keeps trying to do it again. I set an alarm at 6 hours so she can eat but she has very little interest in it. This hasn‚Äôt changed her behavior or eating patterns throughout the day except she eats more during her first morning feed. I guess what I want to know is, is it ok for her to sleep that long at her age?

Her weight never dropped below birth weight and she has been steadily adding on the pounds. At her 4 week appointment she was 8 lbs 15 ounces and today she is 11 lbs 2 ounces.

If you feel more comfortable waking her every 6 hours then do that, but if she‚Äôs fine then don‚Äôt stress! Also she will likely want more milk if she‚Äôs sleeping more so that makes sense. You can check if she‚Äôs dehydrated (the frontal will be dipped if she is, so offer milk in those times as well). But other than that I would say all is okay.

Sometimes I can get dad to give her a bottle then rock her to bed, but it‚Äôs rare. I usually just give up and breastfeed her until she falls asleep. She does not take a paci and I tried a soother and she takes it at times, but then remembers that‚Äôs not a nipple and starts rejecting it. Every time she wakes up I try to pad her and sooth her in the bassinet, but it doesn‚Äôt help as she starts crying for me to pick her up and breastfeed her again to sleep. Also, she does not like swaddles. I have tried sleep sacks as Love Me and Zen zack and she doesn‚Äôt like them. She usually sleeps 4-5 hours then wakes up I BF again then sleeps for 2 more hours. What can I do start teaching her to sleep without BF, swaddled and paci? I feel like sometimes she is overeating and gets gassy. I have even coslept because I literally have even fallen asleep.

We also figured out that every time the AC would kick on, she would freak out and wake up because the vent was blowing directly at her pack and play, so we started putting extra layers on her, and she sleeps so much better, she must not like the cold. We thought she hated swaddles too, turns out they weren‚Äôt tight enough, she loves to be swaddled the way they do in the hospital, with just some receiving blankets, we double them and swaddle her twice. The only other swaddle she will sleep with is the love to dream arms up one. And we keep her hatch on the red light with washing machine sounds, anything else is too stimulating for her. We look for sleep cues and put her to bed awake, if we wait to long and she falls asleep on us, she wakes up when moving her screaming, and if we put her down too soon, she‚Äôs screaming. We wait until her eyes become heavy, and she starts yawning with the red eyebrows. She is also our hiccup and gassy girl, so gripe water has been a godsend and she usually gets between .5-1 ml after every feed.

Our baby sleeps in similar chunks at night and I breastfeed her when she wakes then she falls asleep on the boob again once she‚Äôs full.

If she is gassy you can do the ‚Äúbicycle legs‚Äù 5-10 minutes every diaper change and right before bed, gripe water, and making sure she gets a good burp out after each feeding! I had my baby in bed with me for a while after we came home from the hospital and it worked well for us, if you are comfortable with that! There are ways you can safely share a bed with a baby. Just make sure there are no pillows or blankets super close to the baby, and make sure your house temp is set at a good temperature (68-70 degrees)..altho
ugh I do heat that cooler temperatures are better for safe sleeping. Babies that young don‚Äôt move much while sleeping so you don‚Äôt have to worry about her rolling over on her tummy or into a blanket/pillow for a while.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

on being a great attentive mama üòâ) would be to suggest a schedule/
routine so that both of you are not worn out with feeds AND begin putting her down before she is rooting and showing signs of exhaustion. We sometimes think that patting(this is kinds fast here too) will help but it often overstimulates and then they get in a cycle of not being able to calm/sleep. Create a calm place for her to go down, do a schedule and tey to put her down before ages exhausted. I promise it will help every single time. Getting her sleep set for the day will set it at night. üíï

My daughter is 4months old and since she was 2 months she started doing the same as your daughter when she is tired, she rubs her head to self sooth. Everyone told me ‚Äúsleep train‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. When I tried to at 2 months she was really crying with the routine, so I stopped it. A month later she started to sleep by herself 4hours plus, and here we are about to be 2 months of her sleeping herself. My point is, they do their own routine in my opinion, nobody likes to get forced to sleep. Doctors even told me when she wants to sleep she will sleep. And I‚Äôm glad I listened. Don‚Äôt get me wrong some parents do need to sleep train but thankfully I just let her do her routine on her own.

We have tried everything and my baby is 5 months. She rejected a pacifier up until she was 4 months old and now finally takes the itzy ritzy ones. I would just say try to have a pretty strict routine and she will most likely learn that it‚Äôs time for bed and get used to whatever you do. You may want to try maybe feeding her a bottle before bed and have that only for bed so she knows that is it and then sleep.

At night I would only feed on demand and eventually the stretches that she slept got longer as her caloric needs got met throughout the day.

At this age it's not recommended to do any kind of sleep training and to do everything on demand until 6 months. After that you can start giving he other ways to cope like butt tapping, rubbing back, playing with hair etc. Once your little is good with that move to a crib at naps because that is when you are the most awake and then at night once your little is good with the crib at naps. You'll also want to play in your littles room and rock them or do bedtime routine in their room until it's time to sleep so your baby is used to their room when it's time to start putting them in their crib.

I say, always stick to a routine at a specific time frame. Ours is between 7-9pm, depending on her feedings. Throughout the day, I make sure to feed her every 2-3 hours. Naps are no longer than 2 hours. And by the time it‚Äôs bedtime, we start our routine: 1. Bath 2. Onesie 3. FULL FEED (we feed her max right now 5 oz of formula) 4. Spouse reads a book while I feed 5. Burp then let her digest a bit sitting slightly up in my arms. 6. Put her swaddle on 7. Bring her to her crib and sing her a lullaby (we have a hatch and put it on red light 10% and washer sound 30%) 8. Kiss goodnight 9. Place her in crib and leave the room.

We watch her on our camera until she falls asleep. Usually takes about 5-10 minutes. She sometimes gets a little fussy around 4am so I rock her a bit and give her her pacifier then put her back to bed.","06/22/2022, 02:01:49"

563418241996992,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/563418241996992/,"Mama‚Äôs with colicky babies

I have been up all night and all day yesterday with only 3 hours of sleep yesterday. So if this post is all over the place I apologize! ü•πüòÖ this mamas beyond exhausted.

My daughter is 1 month old since the 13th. She spent 7 days in the nicu. She was having trouble breathing on her own, she had jaundice and needed light therapy for 2 days, she had trouble eating she would eat too fast or not at all. We‚Äôd have to pace her and measure how much she‚Äôd eat to make sure she ate enough. I breastfeed and wasn‚Äôt able to latch her until the last day. I was supplementing formula until I got enough milk in and now I strickly breastfeed. She has been wanting to nurse to self soothe non stop. And since we came home from the hospital she wouldn‚Äôt sleep in her bassinet no matter how hard I tried so I gave up and co slept with her on my couch. but it‚Äôs becoming too much where I can‚Äôt do anything during the day without her crying when I put her down. I have two bassinets, her crib, and a swing and she don‚Äôt like any of them. She is just now getting to be able to sit in her swing for a few minutes but just enough for me to use the bathroom brush my teeth and sometimes she will let me make something to eat if it‚Äôs fast.
But when she starts acting colicky its usually late in the night all the way till early morning time and sometimes I‚Äôm able to get her to calm down but sometimes I can‚Äôt, even when I co sleep. I‚Äôll check her diaper, burp her, rock her, nurse her, but she just won‚Äôt stop crying some times. Then sometimes she wants to nurse but while she‚Äôs nursing she won‚Äôt calm down so I change positions and try to make her comfortable and we will eventually get it or she‚Äôll just fall asleep. But most of the time I can‚Äôt get her to fall asleep unless she falls asleep while nursing.
I‚Äôve been handing it pretty okay but last night was the worst night because I tried to get her to sleep in her bassinet again and I didn‚Äôt give in. I would rock her or nurse her to sleep every time she woke up and wait around 15-20 minutes before putting her in the bassinet and every time besides once she woke up immediately. She‚Äôs been awake since 6:40 pm last night. She‚Äôs fought her sleep so bad but has fallen asleep off and on but nothing more than 30 minutes at a time.
I haven‚Äôt had any sleep, I‚Äôm not able to eat all the time, and I‚Äôm on the couch almost 24/7 because she won‚Äôt let me do anything other than hold her.
When she was in the nicu she slept in the crib there she did wake up a few times before her scheduled feedings but she was so good in there until the last day I spent all day with her and every time I‚Äôd put her in her crib she started crying and wouldn‚Äôt calm down. So now we are where we are.

What advice do you mamas have on colicky babies? What did you do to get your babies to sleep on there own?

I‚Äôm supper blessed and still just as excited for her to be here as I was the first day. And even while she‚Äôs stressing me out and screaming I‚Äôm still looking at her and smiling and laughing at how cute she is. I love her so much but I‚Äôm sooo tired and will try anything to get her to sleep in her own.

I‚Äôm going to let her sleep with me for a few hours this morning and start doing it again today since I haven‚Äôt had any sleep at all. But I don‚Äôt want to confuse her by letting her sleep with me again. But if I don‚Äôt I won‚Äôt get any sleep.

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice at all! And thank you I‚Äôm advance!","06/20/2022, 07:41:07"
563620575310092,https://facebook.com/563620575310092,"You can try gas drops, and colic calm. Also, is she getting enough to eat? You can tell by her hands, if her hands are relaxed after eating than she‚Äôs full if they‚Äôre still clenched she‚Äôs not full. Also, she could be cluster feeding and pacifying herself in you and I know it‚Äôs exhausting. My daughter is almost 6 months old and I‚Äôm her pacifier. You can also try meeting with a lactation consultant to see if she‚Äôs getting a good deep latch. My daughter not being able to latch properly is what has caused her colic. Baby wearing, and skin to skin might also help her get calm down and get some sleep. Hang in there momma, you‚Äôre doing great!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Babies are just so new to the world and are just confused, so you‚Äôre their safe place. My little boy was the same way, I would have to hold him all day and co slept until 6 months old (which was my choice I could‚Äôve stopped earlier but didn‚Äôt want to.) But he was super colicky and wanted to nurse 24/7 those first 10/11 weeks, then after that it just got so much better. Just know that you‚Äôre doing a great job and doing the best that you can right now for baby. Sometimes I would take mine outside and he would instantly stop crying it was crazy how it worked. So I would start taking him on walks everyday and it helped me so much too just getting outside and not being on the couch all day. Also, try a swaddle. My little boy loved a swaddle that used to be the only way I could lay him down when he was that little.

I couldn‚Äôt move that much and so she slept on me and when she‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs on my husband‚Äôs arms - i ignored all the noises that told me that it was dangerous/not recommended/
etc. i didn‚Äôt care bc I needed to rest to heal. My advice: baby wearing, and accept that some babies are just gonna need more lovin‚Äô in their mama‚Äôs arms than others. I sometimes will wear my sling and let her sleep on me while I lay down bc I need to rest too, and the sling will just help to hold her kind of in place so I don‚Äôt drop her. Mine is just over a month old and hubby and I wear her all the time bc she will cry if she‚Äôs put down for too long (even at diaper change station). Plus I think she‚Äôs too little to be able soothe herself so you‚Äôre gonna have to help her, a lot. I just accepted that about mine and my stress level has gone down, I don‚Äôt get that much more sleep but at least I‚Äôm not as frustrated.

563450128660470,https://facebook.com/563450128660470,"I would absolutely try to swaddle her. Love to dream swaddle is my favorite because it's the natural arms up position. And just keep on being consistent! The more you try to put her down while sleeping the longer she will stay asleep as the days pass. It's really tough but just stick with it. The first time my baby fusses she's hungry, and then she's sleepy the next time. She may also be hungry and cluster feeding I won't lie I caved and gave my baby formula to supplement because the same thing was happening with me a month in. After that first time seeing her satisfied and getting more sleep I decided to continue supplementing and I still nurse during the day. It honestly sounds alot like gas as well. Maybe try gas drops? And then it sounds like she's getting overtired as well since she shouldn't be awake very long at a time this young.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563645438640939,https://facebook.com/563645438640939,"Gerber soothe drops are great!
I read that for breast feeding mamas you can put the drops on the nipple & it‚Äôll work that way.
As far as where she sleeps, my son does okay in his swing, but the bassinet‚Ä¶. He‚Äôll only stay asleep in there if I lay him on his tummy.

It's exhausting...
But... its normal. I can't tell you how many times I have seen mommas asking these same questions feeling like you're the one doing something wrong. You aren't. Nothing that's happening is because of you.
I hope you can at least have some peace of mind knowing this is just kinda part of the experience.
That being said...
It may feel like your days are long and you're stuck... But... try to just rest and relax because for now you're kinda gonna be in this for a bit. Especially because it matters to you. Unless you're a heavy sleeper and you won't be able to wake if you 100% fall asleep... then... you gotta get some help from someone. (Pump... ) have someone else be the nipple for a bit :)

I suggest to keep cosleeping of course be careful, get a bed for her to put in your bed so she has her own safe space. She probably just wants you, she‚Äôs still freshly out the womb ü•∞ that way you‚Äôll get at least a few hours to sleep in between feds while she sleeps.

FTM as well with 3 month old who was very gassy the first month and a half until he learned to poop on his own (then we switched him to formula and we‚Äôre learning things all over again). My LO was exactly the same, he would self soothe on the boob whenever he hd to poop so that the milk pushed down whatever was inside and he would overeat then puke. Add to that the all night grunting etc. No advice on that end except for the biogaia drops which helped him pass stools easier and the colic gripe water which now helps soothe him from gassy formula. For cosleeping, we also did the same until about 7 weeks. Had him in the Snuggle Me between us in a king bed and had the Nanit camera on for monitoring vitals. He hated the bassinet, the snoo, the bouncer etc. He loves his crib though. Some babies just do better with the transitioning to the crib directly. We have his crib in our room and sleep better now. And as for the swing, babies are different. They adjust slowly. Our LO just recently started playing in his bouncer at 2 months because before that he could barely recognize the objects and wanted to feel safe on mommy or daddy. Sorry I can‚Äôt provide solid advice but it does pass. The world is so new for them. Just forget about house looking perfect and clean, and if you have financial means order out for another month or so during the week or get your spouse to help out. We had to hire a cleaner and my spouse cooks so that‚Äôs how we managed. I was the same way, couldn‚Äôt even shower most days.

You get them nice and ready for sleep. And lay them down in bed. Then try and leave, as sometimes you have to stay at bedside.
When they cry you pick up. And sooth and calm and lay back down.
And again
And again.
If doesn't cry with you at bed side -\-\ Take a step away.
And another.
When get to pt of baby crying. Pick up. Soothe. Lay down. Take steps and stay.
Talk to babe once getting fussy. Mommy's right here. Your safe. It's time to sleep. Mom will be here when you wake up. Or I'm staying home. You sleep. Idk something. And just keep it up. Maybe this will go on for hours and for a few days. Every sleep time. Every nap. Every bedtime. Every day. All day. For a few days to a week!

Idk on the colicky thing. Um, does she do best when she's ""sitting"" up or like laying kinda up? If it's colic that's like gas, upset stomach, ect. Right? After eating with reflux some have better time keeping them sitting up for a while.
Rub tummy. Try and Xtra burp. Of course gas drops and gripe water. And make sure doesn't need to poo, doing bicycle legs and bring knees up to chest pausing there, and then pull legs all the way out and pause. So tht slowly. Um. Warmth on the belly. Warm baths. Massaging belly.

I intended on exclusively breastfeeding with some pumping so that my husband could give a bottle and bond with baby. My milk never really came in. I'm still only producing a half ounce to an ounce every 2-3 hours/feeding. We supplement with 3 ounces of formula. Until we figured that out my son would cry and be inconsolable. I would pump a few times when someone else can hold the baby just to see how much you're actually producing. My son wants to be held 24/7. We tried swaddling but he was like Houdini and would always escape. He wanted to have his arms out and be free to move. Once he was 8 lbs (he was born at 7lbs 2oz but then lost weight while we figured out I wasn't producing enough) we got a Dreamland weighted sleep sack. The pediatrician also recommended putting a folded towel under his mattress to help with reflux and Mylicon for gas. Now he sleeps 5-6 hours straight in his bassinet. Naps are another story. We don't use the sleepsack for naps because I don't want to confuse his days and nights and undo the progress we've made with night time sleep. If he falls asleep anywhere other than someone's arms (bassinet, carseat, swing, Momaroo) for a nap, he will sleep a max of 30 min. If he falls asleep in your arms and you try to put him down, he wakes up immediately or within a few minutes. He fights sleep so for now I'm still holding him. He tends to sleep longer and deeper when I do. I think the fact that I have to hold him all the time definitely affected my supply. I don't have a chance to eat or drink the way I should or pump for that matter. I didn't want to drink too much because then I'd have to pee and wake up my son or try to hold it until he woke up from his nap (up to 2 hours) and be uncomfortable. When my husband went back to work, I try to keep snacks available that I can eat with one hand - sippable soup, trail mix, granola, granola bars, string cheese, baby carrots, yogurt tubes, Pop Tarts. When he wakes up from a nap, he is usually hungry. I put him in the bassinet for a minute, use the bathroom, get his bottle and my snack and/or drink, change him, feed him, and then eat while he is doing something I don't need to hold him for (playmat, swing, Momaroo or during a drive/walk).

The suffocation and all of that of course the rules for thing along those lines yes is 100% provable.

A deficiency basically and that they‚Äôre looking into ways to test for this when babies are born before they leave the hospital and if they‚Äôre missing this they are also trying to come up with some sort of way to supplement it so that SIDS doesn‚Äôt have a chance to occur. Of course all of those things will take time to develop but they now actually have something solid to go off of to try and to actually fix the issue.
