564406935231456,https://facebook.com/564406935231456,562280428777440,Mine slept through from just a few weeks old i was truly blessed however he’s now teething and he’s all over the place. One thing I would recommend doing is bath bottle bed at the same time every night. White noise if u havnt already tried that. And maybe an extra ounce in the bed time bottle too. Maybe he’s hungry still he’s a big boy like mine and that’s what I did for him he slept like a dream before teething. Also told someone else on here to do that and the next day she messaged saying he slept through the night good luck 🙌🏻,"06/21/2022, 20:06:54"

3 days ago I decided it was time to move her into her own room, we have had the whole bath bottle bed routine for quite a while and she has mostly settled well though would wake every 3 hours
Since being in her room
Day one was tough-
she settled at 7/8 ish (Normally would be 6) and was quite unsettled but then woke at 11 and again at 2
Day two she settled after bath and bottle at 6pm slept till 11 I changed her bum and gave her a bottle and then she slept till 6:30! I can’t remember the last time I had a WHOLE 6 hours sleep
It’s not easy letting them settle themselves as she occasionally wakes a little and yesterday she didn’t nap in the day was that was tough but I feel you kind of have to be cruel to be kind
Good-luck xx","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

We have a Hatch sound machine. I’ll play around with it some more.

I JUST ordered a blackout curtain for her room (where I’ve been trying to get her to go down for naps in her own in her crib). It’s a struggle. She’s still nursing to sleep most of the time. Then wakes when I put her down.

I try to put her down awake first. But she’s not having it these days.

Now we are on vacation and all that practice is out the window. 😂

I’m a teacher and off for the summer. I’m trying to get her used to going down in her room by the fall.

She still sleeps in our room in a pack n play at night.

Hopefully she’ll start to figure it out in the next few weeks. 🤞🏻

She wakes around 8am has a 5oz bottle (doesn’t always drink it all) because she has some porridge and fruits for breakfast. Bath time as soon as she’s finished and usually naps around 10/11

Next feeds are 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, 12am and continues on.

She usually sleeps through the night, gets a bit fussy but doesn’t actually wake till around 4am so if she’s really fussy I try to “dream feed” her and she’ll usually go back to sleep🫶🏽","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Mine is now 6m but began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks so he's taking after me.

-We've done a night routine since 3 weeks.
-He sleeps in his own room, black out curtains, sound machine.
-We follow wake windows/cues, we try to ensure his last one is the longest.
-He eats 32-36oz of formula during the day so he's meeting his caloric needs.

Then we started basically Ferber but with her pacifier, she needs that ninny lol. Took a few days maybe a week or so of letting her cry for a bit, soothing but not picking her back up & putting the pacifier back in when she dropped it. I was shocked when I was so exhausted I just put her in the crib & she fell asleep on her own. I couldn’t believe it lol, now every nap and bedtime we get her in her sleep suit and place her in the crib with white noise and no lights and she’s out within a few minutes, she’ll whine a bit or kick her leg to self soothe but that’s about it. If you’re feeding them to sleep you should try to break that habit. I followed the “put them down awake but drowsy” .

Sleep 7pm-7am, Bottle when he wakes at 7am, solids at 8am. Then he plays for abit and 9am he’s back to sleep till 11am. bottle again when he wakes at 11, solids at 12pm, play for a bit and back to sleep at 1pm to 3pm. bottle when he wakes at 3 go for a walk or drive so he can nap at 4:30pm- 5pm. Solids at 5:20pm, bath at 6pm, bottle at 6:30pm back to bed at 7pm till 7am

I did sleep train him so when it gets to the times for a sleep I just put him to bed awake and he will go to sleep himself within 10 mins and because we’ve been sticking to this schedule he knows what’s coming next and when it’s time to sleep and all that.

Also When we started this schedule we would pick him up and give him a bottle at 10pm for a week or so while he was still sleeping so a “dream feed” which would help him sleep all the way till 7am. Now he doesn’t need it and will sleep all the way thru.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I make sure I feed my 3 month old every 3-4 hours during the day so he doesn't feel like he needs to catch on up eating at night. We have the same routines during the day I give him plenty of Tummy time, play, fresh air/sun outside and brain stimulation to tire him out. He takes 1-3 naps a day. Then around 8pm we settle down, do quite time, he gets his last feeding, a clean diaper, body & face wiped down, clean clothes, I put him in a sleep sack, turn his sound machine on then I rock him to sleep after that i transfer him to his crib. He sleeps 10 hours through the night bed time to morning. I never tried to sleep train him, I just kept up a routine and around 1-1½ months he started sleeping through the night. He knows once quite time starts and we start our night time routine that it's time for bed.","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

Naps are unpredictable still but he's on 4 naps and sometimes will drop to 3 naps, and he feeds on demand (breast) every 3-4 hours but we've had the same daytime and bedtime routine since he was born. Bedtime is Bath, lotion&massage,
change, nurse, bed. He also has the same sound machine since he was born too and he loves his sound machine, he knows it's sleep time when it gets turned on. He has no issues going down at all in his crib, just still wakes every 3-4 hours to eat. He will go to sleep right after he eats but I've gotten a handful of 5-7 hour stretches so I know he can go longer and I know he will be a much happier baby if he did.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

So I'd try giving him a nice snack (breast) alittle before bedtime feeding. My friend weened her baby off night time feedings by doing that (it happened for me by accident lol) also when he wakes up instead of feeding immediately try to sooth by shushing and putting your hand on his chest so he knows your there, if he won't settle in his crib back to sleep, try picking him up and rocking him to sleep. If all that fails obviously feed him. I would just keep doing that till he gets weened off of night time feedings or it goes to just one feeding in the middle of the night instead of many for you sanity.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

To help get in good sleep routine, don't feed him during the night, let him cry a bit and self settle. And if you have to go in there rub his back.
