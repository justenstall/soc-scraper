540028174335999,https://facebook.com/540028174335999,539881091017374,"It’s fine. Babies do a thing called “active sleeping”. They make tons of weird movements and facial expressions while in a deep REM sleep. It’s all a part of neurological development. My LO even slept with his eyes Open and you could see them darting around crazy during active sleep 🤣 The only thing I’ve never seen is the breathing thing. My LO definitely had a weird breathing pattern at that age, which his pedi said was absolutely normal. So maybe it’s just that! If you’re concerned, go get a second opinion. But personally, I think he’s fine. Babies do weird stuff. Good luck mama!","05/22/2022, 16:16:20"

I just think as baby with this age shouldn’t sleep in that position. You should lay him flat Momma and make it sure to put a shirt on, some with short sleeve and cotton(somethin
cool) when it is hot. Babies are still too fragile at this age. Socks is also very important even when it is a bit warm, something cotton(when warm in your area). I hope this helps. Then try to observe if he still do this even laying flat and properly burped bring him to a ped maybe another ped if his ped couldn’t tell why. But I think it is the position of how he sleeps.
God bless ❤️.","05/22/2022, 16:16:20"

constipation and reflux. (All sorted out now thankfully)

564784131860403,https://facebook.com/564784131860403,539881091017374,Please lay baby flat because it could be the angle your little is sleeping in. It looks like your littles neck is scrunched up. If this happens again and baby is flat go get a second opinion and have a sleep study done. The noises are normal but the deep sort breathes with the flared nostrils are what concerns me,"06/22/2022, 10:16:20"

539978111007672,https://facebook.com/539978111007672,539928097679340,Ashley Mendoza hmm yeah I would definitely see another pediatrician maybe even within the same practice. I do that for my son when I want a second opinion I'll see a different doc they sometimes have different opinions and advice. Also ask about possible congestion or maybe bad dreams. But hopefully you get a answer soon. I know as mother I question everything. Babies are so precious and tiny it's hard to not stress about every little thing.,"05/22/2022, 16:16:23"

540176180987865,https://facebook.com/540176180987865,539928097679340,"Bonnie Keller yea, its hard sometimes. But the recline is good to use for the carseat. You can tilt it to a sweet spot. So it's ""reclined"" for baby to be positioned properly.

Also, when they are this little, using things like a swing/bouce seat ect is only recommended by alot baby pros for less then 20min, when you are there to witness, and only if they can sit in it safety (positionally)

But to answer ur Q. I think it's common active sleeping baby there. I can ask my visiting baby RN for you if you'd like. If she's ever seen this before.","05/22/2022, 16:16:23"
