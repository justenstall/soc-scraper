564309981907818,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/564309981907818/,,"Looking for advice to keep my almost 9 week old asleep for his naps. I try to follow the guidelines for the “wake windows” and as soon as I notice he starts to just stare off or starts rubbing his eyes and yawning I start our routine for naps.￼ I take him in his room where it is dark, turn on his sound machine get him in his swaddle and￼ Hold him to get him to start to fall asleep. I’ve tried laying him down drowsy that doesn’t work, he almost starts to startle himself or make himself cry to wake himself. I tried rocking him until he is fully asleep after 10 to 15 minutes and laying him down and he last for maybe five minutes and starts screaming. Today I tried laying him down without a swaddle and laying him on his side and tummy.

Sometimes he can go 3 to 5 hours without sleeping during the day and he is absolutely miserable and overtired. ￼He sleeps fine at night though. he goes down around 830/9 and will sleep until 7 with uninterrupted sleep. ￼￼￼ he still sleeps in a bassinet but he’s getting too big for it. He will sleep on me or in my arms for hours but he will not sleep if he is being laid down. ￼Also I go back to work tomorrow and my mother-in-law will be watching him. I just want him to be able to take normal naps in his crib. ￼￼

He was just put on Pepcid for reflux￼ and he does have a dairy intolerance. Not sure if these would affect his naps but I am just looking for any possible insight that anyone can give. I cannot get anything done during the day because I feel like I cannot put him down. I’ve tried letting him cry it out and he can cry it out￼ for 40 minutes and still keep going 😩 it’s just getting to be so exhausting.","06/21/2022, 15:13:58"

She's very alert and wants to interact in-between feeds and only sleeps on the boob. Think it's common when they are young and there is so much going on in the day. X,"06/22/2022, 07:09:57"

I have trouble having my son stay asleep during naps. He goes to sleep fine (I have to rock him) but then ALWAYS wakes at the 45 minute mark. He isn’t able to go back down without being rocked.

I still rocked him and then put him down when he was very drowsy and then tried rocking less. At first it was only 10 mins, then 20, then it got to a mostly consistent 40 and I could shower and work out quickly in the morning! The rest of the naps I tried sometimes from 8-12 weeks but most of the time I opted for a walk in the stroller to knock him out and get some quiet time mid day and then contact nap so he wasn’t overtired and eventually the other naps clicked. By 3 months I was putting him down fully awake without rocking for all naps with the occasional on the go nap. It takes time! Short naps are expected. Overnights killed me during that time so consider yourself very lucky!","06/22/2022, 10:09:57"

I think you may have a super alert little one on your hands and knows he's in a different sleep space from where he fell asleep. There's lots of gentle ways to encourage it though and takes some time bits it's more practice as this age. Keep wake windows really short and catch him before overtiredness sets in. Is there a way you can get lots of touch and reassurance to him and lie him down while calm?

If you try putting babies down during active sleep, they wake up almost immediately. If you wait about 20 mins until they’ve passed into quiet sleep, they are able to be moved without waking and can sleep through ambient noise. You might also try putting him down in the bassinet (or crib), holding a firm hand on his chest and shhing to help him fall asleep. If he’s not overtired, he should be able to fall asleep with minimal fussing. Good luck! Let me know if you want to chat further about newborn sleep patterns.
