He only wants to sleep next to mommy, he don’t want to sleep next to daddy. And when I put him in his play pen to try to cry it out and go back in there every so often, he don’t go for that… he Cry’s so hard he will gag him self and get sick….
I don’t know what else to do so I just put him in the bed with me and he’ll sleep all night long….
I want him to be able to sleep in his own bed.
Please no judgement for cosleeping…
I even tried using his hatch machine and he don’t like it at all!","06/21/2022, 22:53:04"

She says now she never mind other than the back problems ! But my mom was always my comfort and could have me at peace so i could sleep . She still is now and I’m 21 with a 6 week old . Sleeping alone i will be awake for hours and hours . You may just be what keeps him at peace and since he’s only 7 months that’s okay !! ❤️ your doing great !

Before having a baby I always said, I won't be having my baby in my bed, he will be in his cot next to me. Yeah right. From the first week he was born didn't like to stay in his cot at all. For my piece of mind and my hubby too we kept him with us, he was in my arms all the time. He is 10 months old now we got sleep together, I stay inside his cot (thanksgod I'm very small) until he feels asleep. Than usually around midnight he comes to our bed no matter what. To be honest with you I realise that I don't fall asleep until he his in bed with us. I think it's an habit for both of us now. I'm pushing him to nap on his own in the afternoon for 2 hours, otherwise we Co-sleep even for naps. A part from back pain what can I do? I guess, eventually, he will move from our bed and that's it. I won't let him cry out at all, I would probably die before he falls asleep crying. You are not alone at all!","06/22/2022, 10:06:13"

My 8 month old has also had a lot of problems sleeping alone, as a younger infant it was so challenging to get him to sleep alone or if we did not for long. Sleep sack helped us a lot but not in the day time.

We have started sleeping training him, I haven’t had the heart to do it until now but he escalates quickly. I would say get him to sleeping in the crib before you start sleep training. Get him to sleep on you with the sleep sack on then transfer to the crib. Once he has adjusted to that then start trying to get him down in the crib. Get him sleepy and then put him down in the crib. We are still figuring out the best approach to get him to sleep on his own but have made some good strides. You got this mama!","06/22/2022, 00:06:21"

Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets 🤣.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 01:06:13"

When I kids were young ( over twenty yrs ago ) my babies only wanted mama ! Can be extremely overwhelming & stressful I read an article in parenting magazine that I’ve never forgotten! It does not matter where yr baby sleeps but the quality of sleep u get ! Babies grow to to secure children to mature independent adults from the close bond (so dads yr time later) trust me when yr growing throw the empty nest thing it’s going to be yr sanity that u got that sleep u needed & all & everything for them yr mental Heath will thank you! Don’t forgot to remind them in young adult hood as they grow to confident adults the sacrifice u make of them ! & Condoms are cheaper than child support Please people remember part of becoming parents is sacrifice nothing in life should comes easy without hard work & perseverance ! Do we don’t take it for granted & we want our children to be brought up & not thrown up like unfortunately some are.,"06/22/2022, 11:06:24"

I haven’t had this issue with my guy (7 months on Monday!), but he is in his own room. It was what worked best for us. However, I do still get the screaming baby when I try to lay him down too early. I give him 15 more minutes of play time and try again. But likely won’t work for your situation if it’s a sleep association thing instead.

Also, is this just a night time thing, or any time he sleeps?","06/22/2022, 00:06:13"

But sleep training is teaching your baby how to fall asleep independently in their own space. I’m doing it because I wake up sore every morning from cosleeping & my baby will soon start daycare and I know he will have a hard time napping in the cribs at daycare. He’s so used to be nursing him to sleep for every nap & at night.,"06/22/2022, 00:06:26"
