My 8 week old is unfortunately sleeping 5 minutes durin his nap time (now he does have colic and it is very worse in the late afternoon early evening)

All he wants to be his rocked. But I’m getting nothing done. And once I get him to sleep he wakes up it feels like 2 minutes after.

Just any tips for colic or anything really.

Hi just wanted to edit the post I am also fighting off mastitis, so it’s harder to baby wear him when I gotta help get my ducts unclogged.","06/16/2022, 23:46:27"

Ask your support system for help!!!! Ask them to bring you dinner or to hold the baby. Whatever you need.

It is very overwhelming but those 3 newborn months do go by so quick. It’ll get better before you know it.","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

I would ask a HV to assess the feeding to check for potential tongue tie especially if you've had mastitis and he seems unsettled. As mentioned there is usually an underlying cause e.g. Tongue tie, silent reflux, CMPA, tension, so always good to exclude these.

SfCxUG1nE84 also give this link a watch for support around sleep. I found it really useful with my now 6 week old. Last night was the first night she slept in her moses basket through till the morning waking for feeds. Previously she refused to be anywhere apart from in my arms and would not lie on her back. It's important at this age NOT to do any sleep training methods as he is way too young and needs responsive parenting to feel safe and secure. In the long run you will have a more settled and secure baby ❤️ as mentioned previously 6-8 weeks tends to be the peak for crying and this usually improves by 12-16 weeks so you're likely at the worst of it now. Take each day as it comes. It will get better ❤️

Also last comment - I don't know about the heat pads for tummies some people have recommended - I would check out whether they are actually safe to use for newborns (sadly a lot of stuff marketed for babies is not safe e.g. dockapods/ baby cushion pods despite being advertised and widely available they have a higher risk of SIDS.) I would be careful to make sure what you buy is regulated and approved and doesn't run the risk of malfunctioning or linked to overheating and SIDS etc. I'd ask the pharmacist re: products for colic they recommend rather than buy online as some products will have added things in such as sugar, alcohol etc. It's so hard being a first time mum and companies are very clever at preying on new parent anxieties.

Hold the baby laying back and then roll them from side to side so that the air has a chance to move up. Then you rub their back from tailbone to shoulder blades in circular motions with some pressure. Then you put them leaning over your shoulder to apply some pressure and burp as normal. Repeat if needed !

Both of my kids had them and everything you’re talking about leads me to believe baby might have them. It’s not normal to have mastitis and colic is also a sign. His latch might not be deep enough and so he’s getting a lot of air. Also, clicking while feeding is a sign as well as milk spillage on sides of mouth and short feedings. Until you see a IBCLC to point you in the right direction, not a lot will help until the ties get released by a pediatric dentist who specializes in ties and also with the help of the IBCLC (international board certified lactation consultant) regular LCs or ped doctors are not well educated in this so that’s why I mention the IBCLC As well as a ped dentist who specializes in this. I was in your boat with my first baby and had mastitis twice. Once I found out these things weren’t “normal” and got the help, my life changed. My breastfeeding journey is better this second time around knowing what I know now. In the mean time the only thing that helped with the colic was colic calm and dr browns bottles for me.

From my experience, all three of mine had reflux (two had silent reflux-no spit up) stemming from a dairy (and soy) allergy (all had blood in their stool). What helped was obviously going dairy and soy free (pm if you have questions on how to do this as it’s not easy!) and holding them upright for 20-30 minutes after each feeding. Making sure they burp (try having him sit on your legs and lightly grip by the chin and use your other hand to gently push his back super straight. This usually gets burps out much faster than patting his back over your shoulder!) is important. Finally, my third also had oral ties (tongue tie needed to be clipped by an ENT). This improved her latch so she wasn’t sucking in extra air due to her not quite sealed latch. We also did bodywork by an osteopath since many babies with ties have extreme body tightness, causing them to be uncomfortable. You could also try a chiropractor. Finding a good lactation consultant would also be an excellent first step.

willbys.com.au/

I tried everything until I got recommended willbys.
- colic massages
- gripe water
- probiotics
- infacol
- changed bottles to dr browns
- changed formula to aptamil colic
- burped baby every 20mls
- tummy time

561165032222313,https://facebook.com/561165032222313,561132925558857,"My son was colic for 7 months. Forget the mess … this time won’t be here forever and it will pass. Every stage comes with its challenges. If you need to put the broom down or leave the laundry or dishes then you do that. He needs you. Rock that baby and love him and don’t feel anxious about the rest (try not to). My son would only sleep in my arms .. then he was able to sleep in his bassinet, and swing. Then I’d try him with his head elevated in his crib , that worked sometimes but I’ve had to lay down with him for almost every nap and bedtime to get him to sleep and would transfer him to his crib and he would wake so … here we are 20 months later still co-sleeping. You do what you need to do to get them to sleep. They do most of their growing in their sleep so it’s important they get a certain amount in a day. Especially at this age. Keep him upright for 15-30 minutes (the longer the better) after feeds. Burping REALLY well.. not too hard but firm. Rubbing is good too. Massaging lightly on tummy. Pumping legs like he’s riding a bike. Stretches and lots of tummy time. A lot of burping and burp for a very long time until you get something … they store it way down deep and you may stop and think they don’t need to and move on thinking they are upset for something else. Warm baths. Oval drops and gripe water. Burp throughout feeds (after every 1oz) and you’ll be surprised how much comes out. It will reduce spit up too. My son slept on my chest for a while too .. you’ll get through this. We will always have a mess to clean or things to do but we will not always have them at this age at this moment again. It’s hard don’t get me wrong and stressful at times and I’ve cried a lot lol but it does get better but just try to enjoy the time while you can. Best way you can. If you have to lay down with him then bonus - you sleep too. Keep his head elevated though : crib wedge, bouncer, swing, or car seat. Be near while they are sleeping in them and make sure they are safe and fastened in but it was the only place my son would sleep and I hated it for many reasons but honestly , we have to do what we have to do. I made sure it was safe and I was always by his side he was never left alone in them unless I ran to the bathroom quick but he was buckled in or whatever and I made sure I did co-sleeping safely and although for a while I could hardly sleep because I would always be checking .. he was actually sleeping meaning I could sleep for even 2 hours. Good luck ♥️ stay positive and know he’s in pain and wants his mama close ♥️","06/16/2022, 00:00:00"
