Delete if not aloud
Sorry in advance for the long post…

My son is 4 months and i want to start furber method today🥺😭 what are some tips and tricks you have because my momma heart is already breaking. I don’t want to hear him cry 😪. Do you also happen to have other methods that would work?

Background on my son:
Only falls asleep in our arms, then when we put him down after he’s asleep he wakes right up so he pretty much naps in our arms all the time.

Sleep schedule:
He’s up for 2 hours and only naps for 20 min

Feeding schedule:
Exclusively breastfeeding every 2 hours

His schedule:
☀️Morning wake up: 8:30am
🤱🏻Feed: 8:32am-8:42am
🧷Change diaper
🛝Tummy time: 8:45am-9:00am (won’t go longer)
📺Watch tv: 9:05am-10:05am (starts to complain tired cue)

563497575322392,https://facebook.com/563497575322392,563453691993447,"Just wanted to chime in that our babe is going to turn 5 months tomorrow and we'll be on day 11 of sleep training (TCB — which is a variation of Ferber). We were pretty sure he was past his sleep regression, because he was back to his normal amount of not sleeping 🥴 lol. He'd never been a great sleeper, and we all just needed help. But once we sensed he was at the right point (we'd seen him soothe himself a couple times in the monitor after waking up), we watched through the taking Cara babies classes and he did so much better than we could have expected! There were only a couple hard nights with big cries... My only advice there is to stay grounded in the secure attachment he has to you (TCB's phrases like ""he is frustrated, not forgotten. He's angry, not abandoned"" helped me a lot. We were right there if he needed us and we knew his needs were met!) And, also, we bought ice cream to eat together when things got hard 🤷🏻‍♀️ also did a lot of chores while waiting for pop in times. It was hard, but worth it! Baby boy has slept through the night 4 nights in a row now!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563955578609925,https://facebook.com/563955578609925,563453691993447,"Is he sitting up yet? If so start foods, this helps the sleeping. Ask your pediatrician on how to start this. It’s slow and long! But worth it!
Also naps, once baby is passed out cold, move him to the bed and lay next to him. This will help with the transition to not holding him. It might work right away or might take a while for him to get used to it. Room environment helps if they are dark. Some babies need low noise or no noise at all.

They have gentle techniques online that are different from Ferber. Mine didn’t work with Ferber she just uncontrollably cried every night for an hour til we finally gave up after a few days. Complete torture!
We had to do a pick up put down method to get her to calm down. She cried ALOT but it gets better.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

This was perfectly normal at the time since she was a breastfed baby and had oral ties that caused poor feeds. (She is back to sleeping in the bassinet after her releases because I have to wake her up more frequently for stretches for a few more weeks). I think it all depends on the baby and consistency!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563487071990109,https://facebook.com/563487071990109,563453691993447,I agree with others. If possible I’d avoid TV altogether but if it’s needed because you need a break which is perfectly okay I’d keep it as far from naps and bedtime as possible since tv is very stimulating for babies. If you do plan on doing Ferber you will have to break the feed to sleep association and schedule night feeds for when he isn’t awake.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

You can’t let your LO fall asleep during those feedings either. Day feedings move to at least 30 mins before a nap and bed time.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

563493835322766,https://facebook.com/563493835322766,563453691993447,"I couldn’t / didn’t choose / didn’t even try to sleep train my daughter till she was 13 months. But I’m not sure this was a good decision.
Both of us (me and my daughter) needed the sleep.
Even by the time she was 13 months and I decided to sleep train her (because I really need to sleep better) whenever she cried during the night, I cuddled her but didn’t feed her and keep telling her that we don’t have milk during the night anymore, we just sleep.
Miraculously it only took her 2 weeks to learn this and now she sleeps most of the nights without waking up.
I’m pregnant now and with this second one, I’m sure I need to sleep train earlier. Maybe 4 months is the best time.
But still I would prefer to try softer methods.
Maybe holding him but not feeding him and then gradually he will get used to it and after a while there would be no need for cuddling either.
I prefer slower softer ways to make sure they wouldn’t experience any trauma.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563524141986402,https://facebook.com/563524141986402,563453691993447,"Just remember that the crying is temporary and your baby isn’t hurt.

I noticed my daughter has a “need” cry vs. a fussy cry. Once you can tell the difference, the Ferber method is gold!

My LO is 6 months and we started sleep training her at 4m and she now sleeps 12 hours a night with no wake ups. And she takes two 2 hr naps in the day with a mini nap in the evening.

The longest she has ever fussy cried was 15 minutes. It was tough but laying down boundaries allows your child to learn to self-soothe which will help them for the rest of their lives. And you’ll be able to sleep and relax, which will in turn make you a better provider.

The longer you push off sleep training, the more difficult it becomes later because they create bad sleeping habits.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

To be honest, we read that at 4 months it was recommended to begin so I trusted the experts and went for it. I knew it was going to be fine the first night. She woke up and fussed. I was absolutely exhausted and I delayed going in there. I heard her cry turn to a fussy cry vs. a need cry and then she fell asleep again.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I would feed her, then read a book or sing to her for like 5+ minutes and then put her down so she didn’t associate sleep with food. When I would put her down, she would definitely fuss for a bit but I held strong and didn’t go in. She would fuss a little and then eventually pass out and now that’s routine. I’m not saying that’s right or how it’s supposed to be done, but it’s what works for me. Also, when I put her down, I lay her down feet first and slowly move up her body so she doesn’t feel like she’s being dropped in a random place.

563531225319027,https://facebook.com/563531225319027,563453691993447,"Okay so my son has been sleeping through the night since he was like 1 month and a half. He’s now 4 months old. I don’t really know how to help you much with that but here’s what I do with him. I hope it may help you some how. We wake up and he plays for a while. I let him tell me when he’s hungry, once he starts getting fussy because of hunger I feed him. Afterwards we play for about an hour maybe hour and a half. A little bit throughout that time he may watch like 10 minutes of tv but we mostly play and cuddle during that time. Then he will take a nap. It is anywhere between 1-2 hours. Sometimes he wants me to hold him during that nap which I’m okay with because at this age he still needs closeness/a contact nap. At this age closeness is still a part of basic needs just like feeding and changing the diaper. Then we play and do it all over again and he goes back to sleep about 12-1 and will sleep until about 3-4 and then wake up and be up for the rest of the day until about 7-8 and then he’s out for the night. He did it all himself. I never had to put him on a specific schedule but he does it himself. If I know he’s getting sleepy I will make sure he gets his nap though that away he can stay on his sleep routine. While your baby is still this little closeness/
contact nap is a need. I hope this helps momma❤️","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Was going to suggest changing that around as well . I find if I’m trying to watch a show and I have my baby in the room ,before I put my bbg to bed , she gets CRAZY … the second I turn it off she settles down and goes right to sleep. She isn’t one to watch tv (she did here n there around 3-5 months) so maybe that’s why it bothers her more …my older daughter loved it since day one but I would have to limit it to getting better naps 🤷🏻‍♀️for my youngest, I even found she’d be rubbing her she’s but it was actually just the tv bugging her at times but that’s my experience.

Believe me, I get needing a break n finding a way to entertain but I’d suggest limiting it to shorter times or def not before nap time due to the light and colors being over stimulating.

Or if you feel you don’t want to change that part of routine, maybe look into the shoes that are more muted and less stimulating and you’ll see a big difference in nap time!

I also suggest lavender lotion , essential oils, and bath time before bed to relax.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

But basically he has the same routine every night so bath or wash in the bathroom and then I breast feed him, then I read a story to get him awake again then put him in his cot awake so he learns how to self settle, at first there was a few tears but I put my hand on his chest with gentle pressure as though he’s getting a hug and shush him until he settles. The two methods the sleep consultant suggested is stay in the room until baby settles or leave for an amount of time you like eg in 5 minutes if he’s still crying go back in and shush to settle and then leave for another 5 minutes. Oliver actually picked it up really quick and the first night we only went back in once and he settled. We have the same routine for day naps too so he knows what’s coming, nappy, story, bed. I hope this helps a bit more. It’s just about teaching them how to self settle and get back to sleep without relying on you x","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I used to put the tv on for her with music videos for babies (20min max) but I cut that out completely about a week ago because she also would only nap for a couple minutes and so far is working, so definitely true that tv is overstimulation
for a young baby and you’re doing it three times a day for a very long time. Somebody gave me a trick that I’ve been trying and seems to work.
For a 4 mo baby let him stay awake 1.5 hours and then put him down for nap. During the awake window don’t overstimulate baby and try to do only one or two activities with him, so feed him, and hang out with him and then do tummy time or give him a toy to entertain himself for a bit while he also gets better at grabbing things 😊 and then when he’s napping, not longer than 90minutes and then again all the activities, food, play, singing or just hanging out with you around the house. Stimulate him with books, play music for babies so he can listen to them but not screen, let him touch different textures, show him things around the house or outside.
Also I see that the feedings during the day are short but longer during the night and he’s waking up a lot, you must be sooo exhausted!! Try to feed him for longer perdidos during the day and the last fed before he’s ready for bed make that one a big one so he has a full tummy.
If you don’t have a rocking chair I highly recommend you getting one for him too.
As I said I’m not an expert and I’m trying to work things out since my babi is 3.5! Lol I’m just now seeing some improvement.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

- Getting outside or meeting friends/family helps to wear her out so she’s more tired for her nap
- Following her wake windows but not being too strict so avoiding putting her down early - if she’s not tired enough she’ll cry for a long time
- shutting out daylight an hour or so before bedtime
- no tv for a couple of hours before bedtime

I’m not sure if you exclusively breastfeed and if that works for you then great but I stopped because she wouldn’t settle if not on me as she just wanted my milk, if you struggle with the same issue it might be worth thinking about combi feeding or weaning off the boob before sleep training - I don’t know if that’s an option for you and hope I’m not speaking out of turn x","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

White light stimulates them and the fast moving pictures can not be processed by their brains. Rather let him sit in a bouncer and watch you do your homework or whatever or put him into sling, so he can be near your awake and see things. You can try a play pen with a mobile between tummy time intervalls (maybe you get a longer time frame for that) or place a mat outside and let him lay there, maybe look for a baby/momma group in you area to meet other babys to interact, mine loved that. If you fill his wake time with other activitys than so much TV sleeping will get easier.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

563691645302985,https://facebook.com/563691645302985,563453691993447,"We were told by a sleep trainer, the wake window for a child of 4 months (our daughter's age) is 1.5 hrs and this is because they are statting to have sleep cycles similar to adults (every 90 minutes). Maybe he is up too long and overtired, therefore not falling aspeel easily and waking too soon??

Sample day timline:
7am wake and feed
830am 1st nap
10am wake and feed
1130 2nd nap
1pm wake and feed
230pm 3rd nap
4pm wake and feed
615pm bed routine (30-40 mins)
Bed 645-7pm.
1 Night feed between 12 and 4am only

This is a guideline. Obviously there are modifications but whatever you do, DARK ROOM, and be consistent with your routine 100% of the time as to not confuse your child. We are working on it. Day 5. Nights 1 and 2 were pure hell and she had a tummy bug the last 24 hrs ish. But.... her daytime naps are already on point and we are working on nighttime. My advice is to watch and as the FIRST SIGN of tiredness (rubbing eyes, face, ears etc whatever your child does), PUT THEM IN BED. Good nap 1.5-2 hrs and adjust your timeline as the day goes on. Eventually they will get in the routine. Also, consult your pediatrician. Our girl has reflux and is on meds and they don't recommend any sleep training/cry out methods until reflux is under control.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I noticed when he’s with my parents and they put on TV it over stimulates him, when he’s with me we don’t watch TV or do any screen time (I can only control so much with my parents, it’s fine, no biggie)

And just practice during nap times. I have no clue about sleep training since Mine is only 4 months as well, but we black out the room completely, sound machine, and use his Merlin magic suit. I do calming things before I know the nap is coming and Once I see the sleepy cue, I begin putting him in his crib, he still shows he’s excited and happy, but learned how to put himself to bed without crying!
One nap at a time, just try!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

appropriate.

TV is probably not helping and you want to try get the naps extended so bubs isn’t overstimulated and overtired at night.

My little one did better with a hour and half wake window first thing at that age. She napped longer and started the day off better.

Last nap is probably to close to bedtime so bubs is under-tired and waking up at 10:30 cause of it.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I learned in a free online sleep seminar that at 4mo babies permanently change the way they sleep because of their new cognitive development at that age.

We are working through this with my 4 mo old and it’s actually been a fairly smooth transition.

I think you could use a similar, yet gentler approach if you want.

There is another seminar in July. You could get some ideas from it.

Once I put her down you walk away and set a timer according to the chart. When I did my two minutes visit I did not pick her up just wanted her to know I was there and when the two minutes were up I would leave which she would scream louder and I had to keep consistent with this and the first day it took 40 mins for her to fall asleep on her but by the third day literally 3 minutes so it does work. If you just stick to it and don’t give in (the hardest part ) it works .
