This is my 9 month old daughter, myself and my wife have been trying to find ways to be able to help our daughter to try and sleep through the night but it just doesn’t get us anywhere, she goes down to bed anywhere between 5:30pm (if she’s really tried) and 7pm, she’ll then wake between 9:30-10:30pm for a bottle and will be back up again anywhere between 2:30-4:30am but will be crying as if she’s hungry, now I’m not sure if this is because she’s looking for comfort but we try rain rounds, a comforter, a night light, pillow sprays and she still wakes up, although we completely understand waking up at night is what babies do, but it just seems like she has more bottles than what she should be on. It’s just so tiring and it takes it’s toll on us too as we’re both so tired by the end of the night. So any advice will be very much appreciated

Thankyou! X","06/19/2022, 16:04:27"

Does baby eat any solids? I know that helped us get longer stretches too.","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

I def wouldn't put her down before 7... try a quick nap, as someone suggested earlier ☝️... so when she wakes, u can give her one last meal and a little more stimulation and play before bathtime/
bedtime and routine... so maybe if she goes down later, she would sleep a longer stretch... my baby is 11 months tomorrow, was waking here and there, and is finally on a daily routine, which helps make a nightly routine go smoothly... and we're finally forgetting 9-11 hours at night 😊","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

Waking at the same time doing everything in the same order and nap windows and big feed on the bottle before bathing. It may seem for a few days it's not working but don't give up on her.

He eats a lot in the day and has short naps all day so by nighttime he sleeps. I use to feed him every time he woke up in the night but now I do a dummy no matter how many times I have to go in his room or even cuddling him and putting him down again and it’s worked a treat. He goes down for 19.30 and is up for 7am. See if that helps. Hope it does.,"06/22/2022, 15:03:37"

We let her crawl freely to tire herself out. We would then give her double of a bottle then what she usually takes so her tummy was full for the night. We'd get her to bed around 10 and she would sleep all the way through till 9am. Maybe it has something to do with you trying to get her to sleep so early.. maybe she is napping too much during the day.

That’s def too early for bedtime because their bodies rely on the daylight & sunset to set their circadian rhythms. Also would like to point out that it sounds like you are getting some really good stretches of sleep. Not sure what “sleeping thru the night” is considered for a 9m old but when I took my 4m old for her checkup, doc told me sleeping thru the night at this age is only 5h and she would be happy if mine went 3-4h because she would get hungry before 5. I’m sure it’s longer for 9m old but we see posts of peoples babies sleeping like 12h straight & we think that ours should do that too. But alas all babies are different & what’s normal for one isn’t for another. Hope you get some good sleep soon!","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

Look into night weaning if you want to try to drop one of the night feedings. She might also be going to sleep too early. My dude has his last nap between 5-6 and is up by 7. His last bottle is at 8/8:30 and he sleeps longer stretches with that method - it works for him. He's 4 mo next week (3 mo adjusted).
Edit: you could also try doing a dream feed when you go to bed. That helped my dude sleep longer stretches also. Even 2 ounces gave me a few extra hours.","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

Our trainer said children get their best sleep from 6pm to 12 pm. We are not supposed to feed unless if it between 12 and 4am. Our girl comfort feeds at 845/9pm and it is KILLING ME to deny her. But we are trying to make it work. Stay consistent. She will fall into her new routine over time with you consistency and support.

Because when we co-sleep he sleeps through the night and is a happy baby the next day.

When she wakes up fussing /crying at night. Try giving a pacifier and soothing back to sleep rather than feeding.

When our baby was real little and eating throughout the night we would feed him every time he started to fuss a little.

s I just wanted to let you know this post and picture has been shared by a few almost spam looking posts. They have left your daughters picture attached. The posts don’t seem to have anything to do with baby’s or sleep training tips. It just seemed odd and I wanted to let you know since your girls picture is attached to this.

563261085346041,https://facebook.com/563261085346041,563047958700687,"I think they still need milk as their main food. This is our routine, we do a mix of milk before and after solids and it doesn't make much difference.

- 7am go in and get up (May have already been awake before)
- Bottle 6 or 7 oz
- 8am Breakfast solids (usually berries, porridge or toast, yogurt)
- 0930 - 1000 morning nap
1015 - bottle 7oz and snack
1130/1145 - lunch solids (chicken or eggs, sweet potato or other veg)
1230/1300 - 1430/1500 - afternoon nap 2 hours
1515 - bottle 7oz and snack
1700/1730 - dinner (meat/fish, veg, yogurt/fruit)
1800/1815 - bottle 6oz
start bedtime routine
1830 - (sleep time if woke at 1430)
1900 - (sleep time if woke after 1430)

Day sleep - 2.5 hours
Milk total - 24-28oz
Wake windows - 2.5-3 / 2.5 / 3.5-4 max","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

But at this age it’s hard to make anything consistent because she is growing and ever changing right now and her schedule will change constantly. With that , she will probably still need night feeds.. if shes hungry she’s waking to tell you. It’s hard trust me I know … my son was colic for 7 months then teething and sleep regressions etc and being attached to me but I know this time won’t last forever and I’m trying to make the best out of it the best way possible. Sleep while you can .. i would run off 2 hours of sleep and it was hard but it does get better and easier. Sleep when they sleep but this is what it’s all about lol 🤦🏼‍♀️ try not to fight against it and just go with what baby is telling you she needs. sending good vibes and hopefully you find something that works for you.","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

I would recommend sleep training using whatever method you would like so that she can get to sleep and stay asleep without bottles / any assistance. I promise it is so so doable with a solid plan and patience & commitment!
If you are interested in support from me 1:1 (I make a custom plan and offer support via phone / text for two weeks for 2 weeks ) , send me a message! Or if you would like a suggestion for a DIY option I can send you a link to what I used for my son!
