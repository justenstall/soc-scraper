First time mom here although I raised my sister through my teens. My LO is 8 1/2 weeks old and I guess you could say is sleeping through the night. She sleeps from 6pm-12am, feed and change, then from 12:45am-7am. Which doc said was fine but not to go over 6 hours at her 4 week appointment. The other day she had a bit longer day than usual and I haven’t been setting an alarm to feed because she’s great at letting me know. Well she slept through the night and because I was exhausted so did I. I’m talking 8 1/2 hours! I woke up panicked but she was just fine and woke up about 15 minutes later and drank a whole 6 ounces. I thought it was a fluke but she keeps trying to do it again. I set an alarm at 6 hours so she can eat but she has very little interest in it. This hasn’t changed her behavior or eating patterns throughout the day except she eats more during her first morning feed. I guess what I want to know is, is it ok for her to sleep that long at her age?

Her weight never dropped below birth weight and she has been steadily adding on the pounds. At her 4 week appointment she was 8 lbs 15 ounces and today she is 11 lbs 2 ounces.

Picture of my LO so we don’t get lost. 😁","06/21/2022, 19:20:31"

Our Pediatrician told me as a rule of thumb in the newborn/early stage, the number of weeks old is the number of hours the baby can go without a feed (for example, 8 weeks can go 8 hours without a feed). And of course, as long as the baby is gaining weight, as others have stated. So I say, enjoy your sleep, mama!","06/22/2022, 00:03:53"

If you feel more comfortable waking her every 6 hours then do that, but if she’s fine then don’t stress! Also she will likely want more milk if she’s sleeping more so that makes sense. You can check if she’s dehydrated (the frontal will be dipped if she is, so offer milk in those times as well). But other than that I would say all is okay. BUT I’m not a doctor so if you would feel better with a professional advising you then still go to your appointment.","06/22/2022, 11:03:53"

564466401892176,https://facebook.com/564466401892176,564405658564917,Definitely ask your pediatrician. The advice I got from mine when my daughter was the same age was that you don't want to go over 3 hrs without feeding at that young of an age because their blood sugars can drop. But I think every baby is different and your doctor's recommendation is best. I also think you should be able to call your doctor's office before the appointment and see if a nurse/ assistant can give you advice on what to do over the phone.,"06/21/2022, 22:03:53"

My baby has been sleeping from 6 to 3 since 1 1/2 months and she's a chubby little thing haha. If she drinks more ounces in the day too she may not want as much at night. I'd day don't worry if she'd trying to sleep through the night, as long as she's fed and your both well rested :)","06/21/2022, 23:03:57"

564485798556903,https://facebook.com/564485798556903,564405658564917,I would let her be if she shows no interest. In the beginning I was tracking feedings and amounts to make sure she was getting enough which turns out she definitely was. I used a app and would just add in every bottle. They say online a good judgement is 2.5oz for every pound is what baby should be eating. I went by that and we never had a issue. I would see what happens since you’re going to the pediatrician anyways.,"06/21/2022, 23:03:57"

When I went home they didn’t tell me I didn’t have to do that anymore so I was waking her every 3 hours to feed. Best advice I got around 3-4 weeks was NEVER wake a sleeping baby haha provided they are healthy and putting on weight at a good pace, if they want to sleep, let them sleep. Sleep promotes more sleep.
My LO sleeps through most nights now, sometimes up to 11.5 hours! But usually 9 or so. Mind you, she’s not great at long naps during the day I get x2-3 30 min naps.","06/22/2022, 10:03:58"
