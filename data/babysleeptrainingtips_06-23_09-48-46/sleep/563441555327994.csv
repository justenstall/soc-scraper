Not that they are unhealthy by any means. And if someone is okay with that disrupted sleep then more power to them.

At a year and a couple months i threw away all the bottles cold turkey and he didn’t even notice. I stopped any night feeds by 10 months I should’ve done it sooner but I didn’t mind getting up once.

I never forced them to use different way of how to fall asleep but later on in their lives they used dummy instead or learnt when I stopped breastfeeding them. In my opinion it’s a natural way for babies until they are mature enough to learn otherwise. I understand there might be parents who want to teach their children to fall asleep in early age (I mean few months old) but I never forced it on my kids and just followed their lead as they are all different and have different preferences and needs. For example my first one has to be rocked to sleep but my 6 months old hates it and sometimes prefers to have a cuddle without boob. He has no dummy.

563508198654663,https://facebook.com/563508198654663,563477418657741,"[NAME REDACTED] By creating ""hunger pressure"". Start feeding your baby 15-20 mintues after a wake up. Stop feeding a minimum of 30 minutes before naps and bedtime. Encourage active feeds (avoid just chewing or playing with the bottle). Feed in well lit spaces and don't encourage sleepiness while feeding.

By 6 months old your baby doesn't need to eat overnight. When your baby wakes at night for a feed it's more out of habit than true hunger. If you can hold fast for even one night and avoid overnight feeding, by the morning they will be ready to eat early in the wake period - breaking that feed to sleep cycle.

Your baby may fuss a little but I promise they will be so much happier when you break this habit and let them learn to connect sleep cycles without the need for milk. I make exceptions to all this for traveling, illness etc. so do what feels right for you and your LO.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I don't think there is anything wrong with it early on with a newborn but eventually you want to stop. It teaches the baby that they need your help to fall asleep instead of teaching them they can fall asleep and connect sleep cycles on their own. I think it's important to make exceptions when your baby needs it, but in general sleeping is a skill that once learned makes your LO much happier.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Personally, it became a crutch for my child and I was waking throughout the night often and had to eventually break the habit around the time she was 1 and I seen it’s appropriate for babies to sleep throughout the night without a bottle. I was so exhausted from never sleeping a full night for over a year and I wish I did it sooner but I also felt too bad with her crying lol.

563556321983184,https://facebook.com/563556321983184,563441555327994,"I think from all of the comments you can gather that every babe is different with different needs and wants. You can either follow your child’s lead or force yours on them. I’m also not sure why they have been coined as ‘bad habits’ as another mom once said that she feels it’s a super power like you have the power to put your babe to sleep by feeding and holding them. ❤️ plus I don’t know of any adult that needs their parents help to sleep or needs a drink in the middle of the night etc.
My first child I nursed to sleep and he was up to sleeping 6 hours by 2 months. With every needle he got, his sleep suffered drastically as in he’d wake up every 2-3 hours and it would take the entire 2 months to get back up to a similar sleep time so at 4 months he just got back to 5 hour stretches but after his 6 month needle he was sleeping the night by 9/10 months. I dried up at 13 months and he quit nursing with zero fuss. My second child would wake 4-6 times a night until I weaned him at 2.5 years old and it wasn’t terribly hard to wean him. I told him mommy doesn’t have any milk (as I’m pretty sure I dried up maybe 1 to 2 months prior) and that my nipples were very sore(I was pregnant again and they hurt to have him nurse) I just did it gradually starting with the first night feed and held him telling him I knew he was sad to not be nursing and it was ok to be sad, he is ok, I love him, etc. i would only cave and nurse him when he got to the really upset cry. We cosleep (or did-he sleeps well in his own bed now at 3) but it worked. Didn’t take too long either. He does still occasionally wakes a time or two at night but I’ll take an occasional wake over 4-6 times. Though my new babe (8 months old) sometimes wakes quite often too but I like to think it’s leaps and teething and growth spurts as some nights are great. I nurse her to sleep and we cosleep too. She doesn’t always want to nurse to sleep either, the odd time I have to rock her or let her fuss for a few minutes before she will sleep/nurse to sleep which was unusual for me since my first two nurses to sleep so easily I feel. I don’t mind though as they are only little for so long. My oldest is still a great sleeper at 8.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

lly anything I eat she wants 😂 she has started to slowly cut down on being breastfed on her own. Been stress free for me rather than trying to force anything, maybe I've been rather lucky I don't know but I my little girl is proof that this theory does not apply to all babies. My personal opinion but the pressure on mum's to have thier babies not dependent on them anymore is so intense and stressful, I've gone with the flow with my little girl and not had a tough time. Mum's need to be encouraged to be patient and nurturing, not to condition their children so young to so strict routine.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Arching the back is a way to press the stomach muscles in order to prevent acid from flowing to their throats.. and resisting laying down is also a sign.. you need to decrease a bit her breastfeeding make sure you are burping her again.. keep her back straight even when she is breastfeeding..
when you need to put her in her bed lay her on her left side while using a reflux pillow or put 2 pillows under her shoulders do she will be at 45° pat her back until she falls asleep . If she wakes up again just keep on patting and shushing","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

there are babies who are natural sleepers and they fall asleep anywhere at anytime as if they are programmed to sleep since day 1. God bess your little girl 🥰","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
