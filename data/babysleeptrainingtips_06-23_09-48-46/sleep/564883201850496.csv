Little background I’m a parent educator and I know all safe sleep tips and what not. I am 6 days pp and I am having trouble transferring baby to his bassinet. I change his diaper before feeding. He feeds until he stops and is knocked out and when I transfer him he wakes up instantly but when he lays with me he sleeps all night long. I feed him sideways and he sleeps and won’t wake up. Idk what to do to help him sleep in his bassinet because I know it isn’t safe to sleep with him on the bed.

Pic so we don’t get lost.","06/22/2022, 12:04:16"

I swaddle him, rock him, and let him get into a deep sleep (about 10-15 minutes after he initially falls asleep), then transfer him. We also use a sound machine.

She was waking up every 30mins. I bought a large bed guard and was putting her down to sleep right next to me ( not in between me and my husband) this worked well for us. At least like this she was sleeping for at least 2 hrs straight. Not all babies are the same. With my first born We had no problems at all he use to sleep through the night in his own crib however with my 2nd it was completly differant.

I keep her sideways and place her in the bassinet (sometimes still have to gently swaddle her) and keep 2 hands on her until she settles for a couple of minutes. 1 hand along her spine and the other on her head. After a few minutes I gently roll her on her back and then still keep 1 hands on her head until I think she settles.
Sometimes she still wakes up and I give her a cuddle over my shoulder for 5 mins and then back into the bassinet on her back and hand on her head again. Doesn’t always work but it is normally enough. She sleeps for about 2 hrs.

Due to gassiness, she would not sleep on her back and we had to put her on us. Slowly I tried the side lying feed and sleep position. That worked and I still couldn’t move.. if I did she’d wake up immediately.

Now at 6 weeks, she’s able to sleep on her own. Infact she started sleeping by herself at 5 weeks.

I’d say give them the warmth and comfort they need. Soon they’ll feel comfortable to sleep on their own. Atleast mine did.
Good luck mama, don’t stress.. they are this little and will need you only for so long. So soak it in while you can ❤️","06/22/2022, 13:50:30"

Once you train them to do something it’s going to be difficult to train them to do something else. It takes patience. Make a list of the behaviour you desire and teach that consistently from the very beginning. For now all you can do is to stop cosleeping completely and put baby in the bassinet. Baby wakes up, pick him up soothe and back to the bassinet. It is going to be tough and will take days but baby will forget cosleeping. I don’t cosleep with my baby at all. I do 1 hour of kangaroo mother every day. Baby sleeps in the bassinet at night and on her day bed during the day. I don’t allow baby to sleep in anyone’s arms right from the day she was born.

I thought being a mother would be instinctive and everything would fall into place but it didn’t. I needed help and advice and these are the things I was told that really helped me. Every mother is different and every baby is different too. But repetition is habit forming in all babies alike. Some take longer and some learn quickly. As a mother you choose what is acceptable to you and what is not. For eg I won’t cosleep with my baby at night no matter what because I also think it is dangerous ( fyi I coslept with my puppy until the day my baby arrived🤷‍♀️) but I will never let my baby cry and self soothe to sleep. I find it horrifying and an unacceptable practise. But it is widely accepted and desired practise by so many mothers. So to each their own.

Also I never said babies are puppies. But even if I did, I would still not understand the horror it has caused here. I have a puppy and a baby and do I think they are the same. Of course not. But I did teach my puppy the same way I am going to teach my baby right now. Basic things like sleeping, eating, potty is the same across species. It does not take intelligence. Just needs to be taught over and over until it becomes a habit. I hope this makes sense and doesn’t still offend. If it still offends you please chalk it up to the cultural difference between you and I.","06/22/2022, 22:50:38"

If you do, baby is in your arms a lot and gets the comfort she desires and so will be willing to sleep independently but if she is bottle fed maybe cosleeping is the comfort giving element she doesn’t want to give up. Are you a working mother or stay at home like me? I spend every waking and sleeping hour with my daughter. The only time I leave her is to go to the bathroom and bath time. So she may be willing to sleep by herself and not in my bed. But if I were to be away a lot she might cling to me and want to sleep stuck to me. Like this there are a lot of parameters to consider before coming to a set of rules that work for you and your baby.","06/22/2022, 23:50:38"

I rolled over and she was asleep in the bassinet and she was blue. She has silent reflux and had an episode while I was asleep, I guess my mom instincts woke me up. When we got home (we went to my moms for 3 weeks for moral support) I had a bassinet with high sides made to go in our bed. So I did that in between my and my wife and she slept perfectly fine in there, because I kept my hand on her until she went to sleep. If she started stirring I could put my hand back on her. When she got to big for that, well for my comfort at least, I moved her to a regular bassinet on the side of my bed. She had gotten used to being in a bassinet. She knew if she needed me, I would be there. She is now in her crib beside my bed.

I transfer her using a blanket. I put a blanket completely under her and wrap her up like a little taco. So top open. I hold her till she is good and asleep and I use my hand under her head so it doesn’t flop, and to stabilize her and pick her up with the blanket so she still feels secure, like she’s getting a hug and I ever so slowly let her down in her crib. I put her whole body down but not completely, until she gets used to the cold then I completely lay her down and completely straighten out her blanket. Which happens to be her lovey, she won’t sleep without it, anyways and under her completely flat is the safest way for her to have it. She’s 3 months now.","06/23/2022, 00:50:31"

on your precious bundle of joy, my little one had same story , we used bedside crib from day one and my oh my how we struggled… she wanted to sleep with mommy no matter what so I struggled a lot to kind of try to get her used to crib. I would have loved co sleeping but I honestly don’t trust myself enough when being over tired 🙈 .So when putting her down to crib I used to put my face next to hers and sing or shush her and sometimes that helped, as well as holding her little hands down that they wouldn’t scare her and swinging her body from side to side softly, also stroking the nose bridge. From around 2 months I introduced morning snuggles in our bed with her haha, she sleeps all night in her crib and in the morning around 5-6 am when I’m more rested and alert I take her into our bed and she sleeps another 2-3 h snuggling to my side 😅😅","06/22/2022, 19:50:31"

In The hospital and for the first like 4 days PP he was fine in the bassinet and then after that he’d only go in there for MAYBE 45 mins before waking. Needles to say I was sooooo tired and frustrated. I cried a few times bc honestly I was so tired it was making me nuts. I started letting him sleep in the bed with me, on me, but it freaked me out bc I was so scared he would roll off and get hurt or worse. So, at five weeks in, we made and change that seems to be working. At 7 weeks now, he is still sleeping swaddled and on his back in the crib in his room. It was a hard call to make, but it’s working. He wakes up now about 2 times a night depending on bedtime. We’re still trying to work out when it’s best to get him down, but between 9pm and 11pm is the norm. Last night he went down at 9pm. He STAYED ASLEEP until 1 am and then it took me and hour to get him back to sleep at 2 am but he stayed out until almost 5:40 am. KEEP TRYING things. What works for others might not work for your family. We like HAVE to change the diaper, swaddle him, feed him, all while in the dark playing the white noise.

It was super tiring but it’s also nature. Like lots of people have said, they’ve been all warm and cosy inside you for 9 months! Babies aren’t use to being by themselves. Looks up fourth trimester, that’s quite useful 🙂
I picked my baby up and let her sleep on me. If she fell asleep in the bassinet I’d leave her. I found she preferred sleeping in a tighter space so we’ve used a sleep safe apprived carry cot from mountain buggy instead of the bassinet. It’s a much smaller space and closed in- she can touch all the sides and it’s nice and dark. You could try that?
It’ll get better, one day at a time, you’ll both get there! My baby is now 4 months old and slept 9 hours without waking last night, had a feed and slept another 2. I haven’t done anything apart from create a bedtime routine of nappy change, lavender oils head massage while singing a lullaby (some one each night), and then feed. Oh and following her awake windows. When she’s tired I let her sleep, whether it’s been 30 minutes since her last nap or three hours.

The first two weeks, my husband and I took shifts at night holding him because that was the only way he would sleep. Then, I was able to transfer him to his bassinet when he was in a deep sleep. So I had to hold him for 20 minutes or so until he was in a deep sleep before transferring him. He also prefers to have his hands by his face but his startle reflex would wake him if he was not swaddled. So we got him the Love To Dream Swaddle. He had trouble connecting sleep cycles. He slept better in the doc a tot so that is what he was in in our bed. He had his own space in there and I just slept in a c shape around the dot a tot. I know that’s not recommended for safe sleep, but when we used the dot a tot he had decent head control and the love to dream kept his hands by his face so if he turned his head he was against his hand and not the side. Otherwise he would only sleep an hour at most. I think it’s pretty common for newborns to not to want to sleep by themselves","06/22/2022, 16:50:32"

We warmed up the bassinet with a heat pad and found that really helped. If you don’t have one, maybe lay on top of the bassinet mattress while you feed so it’s warm and smells like you when you put him in

It’s also ok for him to be in bed with you if he’s away from your blanket and pillows and not on your body.","06/22/2022, 13:50:32"
