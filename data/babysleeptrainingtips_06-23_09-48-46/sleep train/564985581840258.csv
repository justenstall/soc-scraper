I always felt like I was chasing the clock all day long and constantly trying to get my little one back to sleep if she would do a catnap. Now I just follow her lead and it’s been going great so far. Some naps she’ll do in the bassinet others on our chest and that fine. She won’t be this little forever. She sleeps through the night 8-12 hrs! ❤️,"06/22/2022, 20:51:48"

Now I just wait for him to show me sleepy cues. I know he likes to have his first nap approx 1 hour after waking but if we're on the school run and he doesnt nap for 2 hours then so be it. Some naps are 35 mins and some are 2 hours but my little man tends to only do longer naps on me. I get myself set up in the lounge with a drink,snacks, the TV remote and him and just sit there as long as he naps. I see it as my chill out time and I savour every minute of it. I'm so much more relaxed this time.","06/23/2022, 04:51:53"

s I also have twins that are 7 months old and for the life of me we could not figure out a schedule and I was stressed out and so were they. They sleep good for the most part at night and during the day they take turns napping and it helps me when they do that so I can spend one on one time during the day with them. I’ll eventually get them going on a schedule but they are my last babies and I want to cherish every moment instead of constantly worrying about time.

I keep getting told that she has to nap in the crib and needs to learn to self settle etc. Don’t rock or pat, just let her work it out herself. It’s stressful! She’s so fussy during this regression and just sleeps on me 10x easier. Listening to that advise only cause stress and upset for the both of us. I just gave up. It’s not affecting her at bedtime by letting her contact nap all day so what’s the problem? I think at the end of the day you have to do what’s best for you and your bub! No use losing sanity over watching the clock or thinking “have I held them too much today?”. They’re only this little once, I don’t want to spend the whole time stressing about sleep. But that’s exactly what I’ve been doing and it causes me to feel angry with her when something isn’t working (sleeping in the cot, self soothing) when it’s not even her fault!

I’ve always been very “type A” and scheduled based so not using a schedule is very hard for me to wrap my head around. What if I mis a cue that he’s tired or hungry? What if he oversleeps one day but doesn’t sleep enough another? How do I know if I’m not over feeding him? (Bottle fed formula)
FTM here 🥲😅","06/22/2022, 22:51:58"

I don’t use black out curtains for naps or try to make it seem like nighttime. I will be quieter while he is napping during the day but I want him to recognize the day vs night. Nighttime I don’t use a light from the hatch, just soothing sound. I think over time this will help him naturally know the difference.

I used to go out and do plans.. he'll sleep in the car or maybe between my arms when I reach my destination..
