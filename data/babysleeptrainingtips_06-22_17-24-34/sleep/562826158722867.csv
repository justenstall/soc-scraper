I keep reading about how many once’s you feed your babies and I have a question about that. I have a 5.5 month old and I give her 5 ounces. I’m not sure if maybe this is why she keeps waking up after midnight. Just asking to see how much you feed your babies and if it helps them sleep longer

563170905355059,https://facebook.com/563170905355059,562826158722867,Every baby is going to be different. I would just try feeding until they are full. They will push the bottle away. My son will be 5 months on the 26th and he eats 7oz before bed and in the morning and 6oz during the day. Sleeps 8p-730a with no wakings,"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"
564451245227025,https://facebook.com/564451245227025,562826158722867,"My 9 week old eats anywhere from 4-5oz and eats about every 3 hours. If she happens to wake during the night (sometimes she doesn’t) it’s only once to feed. We make a 5oz bottle every time and let her eat as much of it as she wants. She doesn’t tend to do 5oz every feeding, but for sure her morning, bedtime, and her middle of the night feeding if she wakes for it.","06/21/2022, 21:33:08"

Our baby is 4 months and he said she should be eating about 6 ounces every 4 hours - since we’ve been doing that she hasn’t woken up for a nighttime feed (fingers crossed),"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

564464088559074,https://facebook.com/564464088559074,562826158722867,My baby is 2m old and weighs 13 pounds. She was 9lbs11oz at birth so take into consideration that she’s a big girl. But I found that breastmilk is thinner and she eats/wakes more frequently. But with anywhere between 4-6oz of formula it fills her up longer before bed and she usually sleeps 6.5 hours before her next feeding in the really early morning (3-4am) . Then another 4oz usually holds her over between 7-9am. Hope that helps! The little cutie may just need more before bed!,"06/21/2022, 21:33:08"

563082838697199,https://facebook.com/563082838697199,562826158722867,Im a FTM. My LO is 11 weeks old as of yesterday. She was born a big girl so her feeds have been demanding. I mainly feed bubba on the boob and i feed until she pulls off. Sometimes she could be on a boob up to 45 mins and the other boob between 15 to 20 mins and pulls herself off. Only from time to time i give her a top up if needed from formula. But everyones LO is all different as to how much they need as long as they are gaining weight. At the end of the day just do what is right for you and bubba. She beautiful too by the way 😁,"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"
