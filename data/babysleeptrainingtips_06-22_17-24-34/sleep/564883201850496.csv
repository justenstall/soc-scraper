Little background I’m a parent educator and I know all safe sleep tips and what not. I am 6 days pp and I am having trouble transferring baby to his bassinet. I change his diaper before feeding. He feeds until he stops and is knocked out and when I transfer him he wakes up instantly but when he lays with me he sleeps all night long. I feed him sideways and he sleeps and won’t wake up. Idk what to do to help him sleep in his bassinet because I know it isn’t safe to sleep with him on the bed.

Pic so we don’t get lost.","06/22/2022, 12:04:16"

He also slept the best this way. It’s pretty normal for a baby to want to sleep next to his mother. Every species sleeps with their babies, but humans 🤷🏼‍♀️. Eventually they DO sleep alone. It starts to become natural for them to sleep alone. Soak it up, sleep with your baby, and get some rest 😊","06/22/2022, 13:25:34"

I had the same issue but with repetition he will get used to it. If you can wrap a shirt of yours that you wore all day to fit his bassinet mattress so he has the smell.

Due to gassiness, she would not sleep on her back and we had to put her on us. Slowly I tried the side lying feed and sleep position. That worked and I still couldn’t move.. if I did she’d wake up immediately.

Now at 6 weeks, she’s able to sleep on her own. Infact she started sleeping by herself at 5 weeks.

I’d say give them the warmth and comfort they need. Soon they’ll feel comfortable to sleep on their own. Atleast mine did.
Good luck mama, don’t stress.. they are this little and will need you only for so long. So soak it in while you can ❤️","06/22/2022, 13:25:34"

Once you train them to do something it’s going to be difficult to train them to do something else. It takes patience. Make a list of the behaviour you desire and teach that consistently from the very beginning. For now all you can do is to stop cosleeping completely and put baby in the bassinet. Baby wakes up, pick him up soothe and back to the bassinet. It is going to be tough and will take days but baby will forget cosleeping. I don’t cosleep with my baby at all. I do 1 hour of kangaroo mother every day. Baby sleeps in the bassinet at night and on her day bed during the day. I don’t allow baby to sleep in anyone’s arms right from the day she was born. She is 1 month old now. Your baby is a clean slate. She will learn only what you teach her. So if you r disciplined and consistent baby will be too 😘 hope this helps.","06/22/2022, 13:25:34"

Renee Santos the ONLY expert in your baby is YOU. Do what feels right and comfortable and what’s best for your little one and family. This is the only day they’ll be this little. Soak up every moment. I’m personally not a fan of “training” your baby to do anything. I have a 3mo old and he’s never been on a set schedule. We feed on demand and we take our ques from him. And cuddle him every chance we get 🥰. Most important thing is that they are fed, dry, clean, and loved.","06/22/2022, 16:25:41"

I wouldn’t necessarily like to think of my baby as a puppy but I understand your concept. Also it’s never too late to establish a routine.

If he woke up, I'd tend to him and put him back. I would do that until it was time for us to go to bed. Next time that he woke up, he'd come to bed with us for the rest of the night. Each week, he'd sleep a little longer in his bassinet for that first stretch. Then, at 2 months, he started sleeping till 2am.

At 6 days old though babies are programmed to biological need you. It is very normal for them to only sleep on you. Don’t be discouraged I know it’s exhausting but it won’t last forever and you will miss those tinny smooshy snuggles. It’s all about survival in the first few weeks so do what works for your family.

I have found my saving grace to be the dock a tot. It’s not super safe either, but it’s better than me falling asleep holding her. I put the dock a tot either beside me on the bed or in the crib.

564922101846606,https://facebook.com/564922101846606,564883201850496,"So this happened with my son too. In The hospital and for the first like 4 days PP he was fine in the bassinet and then after that he’d only go in there for MAYBE 45 mins before waking. Needles to say I was sooooo tired and frustrated. I cried a few times bc honestly I was so tired it was making me nuts. I started letting him sleep in the bed with me, on me, but it freaked me out bc I was so scared he would roll off and get hurt or worse. So, at five weeks in, we made and change that seems to be working. At 7 weeks now, he is still sleeping swaddled and on his back in the crib in his room. It was a hard call to make, but it’s working. He wakes up now about 2 times a night depending on bedtime. We’re still trying to work out when it’s best to get him down, but between 9pm and 11pm is the norm. Last night he went down at 9pm. He STAYED ASLEEP until 1 am and then it took me and hour to get him back to sleep at 2 am but he stayed out until almost 5:40 am. KEEP TRYING things. What works for others might not work for your family. We like HAVE to change the diaper, swaddle him, feed him, all while in the dark playing the white noise.

565003245171825,https://facebook.com/565003245171825,564920011846815,Rachel Orr Wolfe yes between 6-8 weeks would sleep in bassinet at night after being rocked. But the daytime naps were always a struggle until about 5/6 months. My youngest is 12 weeks and she does a 6 hr stretch at night followed by a 2-4 hr stretch so that gets much better but the daytime naps in the bassinet are 30-40 min which is normal but no fun. I cheat and let her do a 2 hr nap in the swing during the day but will stop that at 4 months and only use crib for everything.,"06/22/2022, 16:31:52"

The first two weeks, my husband and I took shifts at night holding him because that was the only way he would sleep. Then, I was able to transfer him to his bassinet when he was in a deep sleep. So I had to hold him for 20 minutes or so until he was in a deep sleep before transferring him. He also prefers to have his hands by his face but his startle reflex would wake him if he was not swaddled. So we got him the Love To Dream Swaddle. He had trouble connecting sleep cycles. He slept better in the doc a tot so that is what he was in in our bed. He had his own space in there and I just slept in a c shape around the dot a tot. I know that’s not recommended for safe sleep, but when we used the dot a tot he had decent head control and the love to dream kept his hands by his face so if he turned his head he was against his hand and not the side. Otherwise he would only sleep an hour at most. I think it’s pretty common for newborns to not to want to sleep by themselves","06/22/2022, 16:25:34"

We warmed up the bassinet with a heat pad and found that really helped. If you don’t have one, maybe lay on top of the bassinet mattress while you feed so it’s warm and smells like you when you put him in

It’s also ok for him to be in bed with you if he’s away from your blanket and pillows and not on your body.","06/22/2022, 13:25:35"
