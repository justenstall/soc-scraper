Weighted swaddles and blankets should not be used on sleeping babies, according to new recommendations released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. More guidelines here.","06/21/2022, 10:48:02"

However all of these rules have changed over and over throughout the years. They don’t technically know what causes SIDS. They’re guessing to an extent. The suffocation and all of that of course the rules for thing along those lines yes is 100% provable. I was just reading a study last month that the cause of SIDS has recently been linked to an issue in some babies brains at birth that lacks a specific aspect to wake them when they’re in a deep sleep. A deficiency basically and that they’re looking into ways to test for this when babies are born before they leave the hospital and if they’re missing this they are also trying to come up with some sort of way to supplement it so that SIDS doesn’t have a chance to occur. Of course all of those things will take time to develop but they now actually have something solid to go off of to try and to actually fix the issue. In the article it also said because this discovery has been made, parents who have had a baby die of SIDS can stop blaming themselves for it because it’s nothing they did or used that caused it.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
