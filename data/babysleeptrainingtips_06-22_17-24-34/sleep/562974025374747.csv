So instead of grabbing them immediately to pick them up, you slowly wait longer and longer each time when he/she cries. 5 min wait, 10, 20,30, so on so fourth.

During 4 month regression had a few night of war ups every hour and rough naps during the day but I stuck to our routine as much as possible and it really helped her!!!! I am up through the night to pump so then I offer pumped breast milk in a bottle and dream feed her. We are on a close routine and I swear by it. She's a great napper too. I don't get it when moms don't rely on routine for their LO and just ride the flow. My baby thruves on routine,"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

When we get up we immediately get dressed, eat, and play. When it’s time for naps I change her bottom, put on a sleep sac, sound machine, and light off. After 10 minutes of rocking, she goes in her crib and typically sleeps for an hour and a half. That is repeated throughout the day. For bed time, we read a story, bath, lotion, sleeper, sleep sac, sound machine, and small lamp, and a bottle. After she eats and burps, I rock for 10 min and lay her in crib.

The picture is our current schedule. I’d HIGHLY recommend picking up the moms on call book. There were a ton of helpful tips and routine ideas to help.","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

It was really hard so we only do it for 2 naps a day, then I would hold her or let her sleep in the mamaroo. Feel free to message me with any questions or anything anytime 🙂","06/19/2022, 00:00:00"
