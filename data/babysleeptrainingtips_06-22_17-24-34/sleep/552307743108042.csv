He's not quite 3 months. He won't be until the 9th of June.....yes I'm encouraging him in the video....but I was trying to go for reassurance!

Also another thing to ask! He has not been wanting to sleep in his crib during the day and not wanting to sleep in general! He was up practically all day yesterday with no naps....he's doing it again today.....halfway through the day already.....I can't get anything done around the house! I have tried carrying him in a front pack carrier and he absolutely hates it, unless it's his dad!","06/03/2022, 14:18:03"

no matter what the reason it's happening. I learned after my first is we are not medical professionals and all the worrying I did with my first was in vein. My son is 6 and healthy and thriving and the only thing I look back on and kick myself for is worrying so much. Now my youngest who's 7 months old has rolled since birth and he's healthy and strong. Usually there are other signs signs with cerebral palsy like not putting there head up, low muscle tone etc and your doctor does those tests at every appt since birth. That's why the hold weight on your babies legs to see if your baby is stiff or bounces etc. It is a marker for their muscle tone.","06/22/2022, 09:40:34"

I suggest the lay down pick up thing..

You get them nice and ready for sleep. And lay them down in bed. Then try and leave, as sometimes you have to stay at bedside.
When they cry you pick up. And sooth and calm and lay back down.
And again
And again.
If doesn't cry with you at bed side -\-\ Take a step away.
And another.
When get to pt of baby crying. Pick up. Soothe. Lay down. Take steps and stay.
Talk to babe once getting fussy. Mommy's right here. Your safe. It's time to sleep. Mom will be here when you wake up. Or I'm staying home. You sleep. Idk something. And just keep it up. Maybe this will go on for hours and for a few days. Every sleep time. Every nap. Every bedtime. Every day. All day. For a few days

Yes it'll be alot of work. Standing there and waiting it out and all. Mmm. 💞

But, then I realized I did the same thing during pregnancy and it always made things worse even if I thought searching something wouldn’t bring up anything bad. When I told my pediatrician she told me to stay off google and that some babies do this and they might lose the ability for a little while and gain it back again.

Don’t read what the internet says.

Enjoy your baby day by day. They change so quickly and each day is a miracle.

Your baby is your baby. Worrying what your baby could be. Isn’t helping your baby. Just relax. Babies have been raised for thousands of years without google.

Keep your baby google free.","06/01/2022, 17:40:35"
