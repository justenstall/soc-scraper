Sleep training was hard at first because we started putting him down awake and he wasn\u2019t used to it but we knew he has to learn to put himself to sleep. We check on him after 5 min of crying then 10 then 15 if he hasn\u2019t fallen asleep. Naps he started falling asleep in less than 5 minutes. Bedtime is usually fine but waking at night we might check on him twice. We do a dark room, white noise, comfortable temp around 68, sleep sack, and a bedtime routine. I also just learned that it\u2019s recommended to put them down before 8 pm. We aim for 7:30. Also to not remove them from the bed while crying to not reinforce the crying. I\u2019m amazed how well it\u2019s been working. If I nurse at night I pick up asleep.",

The schedule I\u2019m following I feed him around 5:30 (we\u2019re on solids) until he seems full then I nurse or bottle before bed and that works for us. If your little seems to wake around the same times hungry.

I was in a bad habit of cosleeping just so I could get any sort of rest as I\u2019m breastfeeding. Recently I\u2019ve been trying to break this habit so that he can sleep better and safer on his own. It seems to not matter if he\u2019s in a swing, in his crib, bassinet, anything. He can be dead asleep and as soon as I put him down he\u2019s fussing, the paci is won\u2019t help but sometimes patting does but as soon as I stop he\u2019s fussing again. Since birth he\u2019s been able to roll from his back to his belly and is able to roll from his belly to back now and has great head control so during naps I allow him to sleep on his stomach (never unattended) but now he will not sleep on his back. I\u2019ve tried white noise and I always have a fan on. He hates to be swaddled and will scream until he is out of it \ud83d\ude2d. I really want to stop cosleeping I had one night where he slept 5 hours in his crib (10:30pm to 3:30am and his pediatrician said it\u2019s okay for him to sleep longer stretches) since then he will not let me put him in his crib to sleep.",

He's now 9 weeks and follows the same pattern every night - down at around 8/9pm, sleeps till 1/2am then down again for 2 hours, wakes for a feed, then another 2 hours and then he's up for the morning till nap time at around 11am-ish, though sometimes he skips this one and goes straight through till about 4pm. I promise it does get better! We're already seeing a huge change, and hoping soon he might drop the second night feed and go through from 2am to morning \ud83e\udd1e",

Went on till she was 2 months then I finally gave in and put her on her tummy and she slept for 6 hours. She 5 months now and sleeps for 9 hours. She switches from her front to her side now.\n\nThe first night is scary, I hardly slept \ud83d\ude05 but once the first night is done and I knew she had slept and was no longer fussy or grumpy in the day, I managed to sleep the next night with no worries.\n\nI find health visitors purposely try to scare us into making our babies sleep on there backs, when the is no proven cause for SIDS, it still happens to babies who sleep on there backs, sides, swaddled. My mum was told to put me on my tummy and my nan was told to swaddle and put baby on there side. No doubt I'll all change again in the next 10 years.\n\nEvery baby is different, you've just got to find what suits your baby best \ud83e\udd70\n\nYour doing great mamma and baby is a beautie! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

I read that the cry it out method can only cause anxiety, and the best thing to do is to let them cry it out no more than 5 minutes before picking them back up and coaxing him back to sleep. If he wakes up when you try to put him down, repeat and eventually he will wear himself out fighting without hurting his vocals or feeling isolated after being so used to co sleeping. I didn\u2019t learn this until a little later, my son is 6 months old now and I still most of the time have to put him to sleep myself. But he is learning to self soothe bit by bit! He would never take a pacifier and prefers I pat his back gently as he falls asleep! Keeping soothing lavender scented things around is a good way to help them sleep peacefully but I was told never to apply anything scented to their skin. And you can find baby soothe lavender spray at Walmart! I\u2019m told Hello Bello is the best one to use!",

Best of luck mama, time really does fly and you will sleep again through the night.

But we were not ready to transition to his actual crib because he\u2019s meant to eventually share a room with his big sister. He still had/has very frequent wakeups in the night and would wake up big sister, so instead- we bought a mini crib for our room. It\u2019s the same width as the a normal crib, but a foot shorter. So it takes up way less room! He transitioned to that without any issues. I think mostly because he was still in the room with us. I hope this will make the transition to the bigger crib easier in the future",

I only let him sleep like that when I\u2019m awake and watching him but not sure what to do about night time. Anyone else have a tummy sleeper?

I usually just give up and breastfeed her until she falls asleep. She does not take a paci and I tried a soother and she takes it at times, but then remembers that\u2019s not a nipple and starts rejecting it. Every time she wakes up I try to pad her and sooth her in the bassinet, but it doesn\u2019t help as she starts crying for me to pick her up and breastfeed her again to sleep. Also, she does not like swaddles. I have tried sleep sacks as Love Me and Zen zack and she doesn\u2019t like them. She usually sleeps 4-5 hours then wakes up I BF again then sleeps for 2 more hours. What can I do start teaching her to sleep without BF, swaddled and paci? I feel like sometimes she is overeating and gets gassy. I have even coslept because I literally have even fallen asleep.\n\nAlso, what they mean when they try to dig their head like this?",

We also figured out that every time the AC would kick on, she would freak out and wake up because the vent was blowing directly at her pack and play, so we started putting extra layers on her, and she sleeps so much better, she must not like the cold. We thought she hated swaddles too, turns out they weren\u2019t tight enough, she loves to be swaddled the way they do in the hospital, with just some receiving blankets, we double them and swaddle her twice. The only other swaddle she will sleep with is the love to dream arms up one. And we keep her hatch on the red light with washing machine sounds, anything else is too stimulating for her. We look for sleep cues and put her to bed awake, if we wait to long and she falls asleep on us, she wakes up when moving her screaming, and if we put her down too soon, she\u2019s screaming. We wait until her eyes become heavy, and she starts yawning with the red eyebrows. She is also our hiccup and gassy girl, so gripe water has been a godsend and she usually gets between .5-1 ml after every feed. Text me and I can show you how we swaddle her, I had to teach Charlee and Jared and now they are both pros lol",

Our baby does the same thing to anybody that hold her that way. As for the wake ups, sleeping 4-5 hrs is so great for 2 months and she needs to be fed after that long stretch. Our baby sleeps in similar chunks at night and I breastfeed her when she wakes then she falls asleep on the boob again once she\u2019s full. It works out great because I just put her back in her bassinet, completely full, and she goes back to sleep for another 4 hr chunk",

I would say just start on good sleep habits now..example: feed her (bottle or breast) then read her a story THEN put her to bed..so she\u2019s not associating the milk with bedtime. If she is gassy you can do the \u201cbicycle legs\u201d 5-10 minutes every diaper change and right before bed, gripe water, and making sure she gets a good burp out after each feeding! I had my baby in bed with me for a while after we came home from the hospital and it worked well for us, if you are comfortable with that! There are ways you can safely share a bed with a baby. Just make sure there are no pillows or blankets super close to the baby, and make sure your house temp is set at a good temperature (68-70 degrees)..altho\nugh I do heat that cooler temperatures are better for safe sleeping. Babies that young don\u2019t move much while sleeping so you don\u2019t have to worry about her rolling over on her tummy or into a blanket/pillow for a while.",

She\u2019s 13 months \ud83d\ude43 I wish I would have started sleep training so much earlier\u2026. During the day breastfeeding to sleep stopped working around like 5 months so then I had to rock her to sleep. That stopped working around like 9 months so I had to walk her in a stroller\u2026. I hope someone has some words of wisdom to help so you don\u2019t have to spend HOURS trying to get your baby to sleep like I did the past year. For sleep training I put her in her crib with the light up sound machine I got on Amazon last month and it has been amazing! She finally gets herself to sleep on her own \ud83e\udd72",

We sometimes think that patting(this is kinds fast here too) will help but it often overstimulates and then they get in a cycle of not being able to calm/sleep. Create a calm place for her to go down, do a schedule and tey to put her down before ages exhausted. I promise it will help every single time. Getting her sleep set for the day will set it at night. \ud83d\udc95\nMommydoula.net",

My daughter is 4months old and since she was 2 months she started doing the same as your daughter when she is tired, she rubs her head to self sooth. Everyone told me \u201csleep train\u201d I didn\u2019t. When I tried to at 2 months she was really crying with the routine, so I stopped it. A month later she started to sleep by herself 4hours plus, and here we are about to be 2 months of her sleeping herself. My point is, they do their own routine in my opinion, nobody likes to get forced to sleep. Doctors even told me when she wants to sleep she will sleep. And I\u2019m glad I listened. Don\u2019t get me wrong some parents do need to sleep train but thankfully I just let her do her routine on her own. And yeah it\u2019s tiring I went 3 months on barely any sleep, every 2hrs she was up but thankfully now I get the besttttt sleep \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

I would just say try to have a pretty strict routine and she will most likely learn that it\u2019s time for bed and get used to whatever you do. You may want to try maybe feeding her a bottle before bed and have that only for bed so she knows that is it and then sleep.

My firat baby is currently 7, but ended up co-sleeping with us forever because it was just sooo much easier, especially while nursing. This time around i'd like to change that. I was all about the Halo bassinet as it always gets rave reviews, but since it does not attach to the bed, or have a side that comes down to scootch the baby over, I feel like it may be more work than I want. Regardless of the brand, is an adjustable side an important feature to have, especially for nursing mammas?",

No signs of colic so I know it is gas. His gas wakes him up and keeps him up through the night. He is breastfeeding only and I have switched up the position to make sure he is not swallowing air. I make sure to feed him before he starts getting irritable. I burp during and after the feeding. And I do all the exercises like massage and knee tuck to help him pass the gas. I also give him the gas drops which he loves the taste of (not sure if actually helping though ) Any advice so I can make my little one more comfortable?",

He was also having massive vomits every now and again and explosive nappies several times a day. Also, looking back, he was very congested in his nasal passages. No snot, just struggling to breathe through his nose which was stressful as babies are nose breathers.\nWe stopped dairy and soya. I was told by my health visitor that soya protein looks almost identical to dairy protein which is why it\u2019s advised to cut both. I\u2019d say the blood and mucus lessened but continued for a good 2 months before stopping completely. The explosive poos also continued for a little while. If it is an intolerance, it may take a while. Also, check food labels thoroughly!! There\u2019s milk protein and soya where you\u2019d least expect it. Doritos have milk in them. All Hovis bread has soya. Some sausages have milk protein in them, for example.\nWe\u2019ve seen a paediatrician now and been given advice on how to wean them back into firstly my diet (he\u2019ll be exposed through my breast milk) then if that goes well we introduce into his diet.",

Not only did she have a lip and tongue tie which contributed to a poor latch and taking in too much air, I also ended up cutting out dairy which has helped her tremendously. Before I did she had gas nonstop and was in so much discomfort and pain from it not to mention her gas was super super smelly. Now she only has gas here and there and it doesn\u2019t smell like it used to at all. Also, since her lip and tongue tie revision, we\u2019ve been taking her to a chiropractor which has helped tremendously with her sick and swallow as well as some GI work and getting things straightened out and symmetrical since 9 months in a cramped environment sure does a number on babies. I wish I had known all of this when I had my first 2 kids 10 years ago. These kind of resources/\nknowledge wasn\u2019t so widely talked about back then.",

Dairy and gassy foods like onion, cabbage, broccoli, and takeaway foods can cause him to be gassy as well, basically anything that could potentially upset your tummy and/or give you gas will have the same affect on bub, it's so hard to pin point what it could be in your diet though so don't start being too strict on yourself \ud83e\udd17",

Both had to be released and after that she was a whole new baby. She didn\u2019t sound like she was swallowing air when eating but obviously was. And I was burping half way through and after as well. The only difference from my little one to yours was she wasn\u2019t gaining weight. And was diagnosed with failure to thrive at 3 weeks old and was about a week away from being hospitalized for malnutrition. but once they were released she gained a whole 13 oz in one week. Pic of my little, you could tell something wasn\u2019t right her eyes and soft spot were sunken in and you can\u2019t tell from the picture but you could see every bone in her skull in full detail",

I've switched to biogaia for colic ans digestive comfort and it has helped.\n\nI started keeping a food journal and I noticed that he would cry with gas pains when I ate- gluten, dairy, chocolate, coconut.\nI also found a goat formula that I felt comfortable with and started giving formula only for bed time to help support longer sleeping periods.\n\nWe visit a chiropractor and it has been taking a few weeks but I am now starting to see improvement s in overall comfort.\n\nMy little man did have a tongue, lip and amd cheek tie. He is now able to latch without the shield which has lessened possible air getting in during feeding.\n\nIt has been a lot of trail and error but I would suggest start with 1 thing at a time so you know if it is working or helping.\nBest of luck!",

		"text": "Mama\u2019s with colicky babies\n\nI have been up all night and all day yesterday with only 3 hours of sleep yesterday. So if this post is all over the place I apologize! \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude05 this mamas beyond exhausted.\n\nMy daughter is 1 month old since the 13th. She spent 7 days in the nicu. She was having trouble breathing on her own, she had jaundice and needed light therapy for 2 days, she had trouble eating she would eat too fast or not at all. We\u2019d have to pace her and measure how much she\u2019d eat to make sure she ate enough. I breastfeed and wasn\u2019t able to latch her until the last day. I was supplementing formula until I got enough milk in and now I strickly breastfeed. She has been wanting to nurse to self soothe non stop. And since we came home from the hospital she wouldn\u2019t sleep in her bassinet no matter how hard I tried so I gave up and co slept with her on my couch. but it\u2019s becoming too much where I can\u2019t do anything during the day without her crying when I put her down. I have two bassinets, her crib, and a swing and she don\u2019t like any of them. She is just now getting to be able to sit in her swing for a few minutes but just enough for me to use the bathroom brush my teeth and sometimes she will let me make something to eat if it\u2019s fast.\nBut when she starts acting colicky its usually late in the night all the way till early morning time and sometimes I\u2019m able to get her to calm down but sometimes I can\u2019t, even when I co sleep. I\u2019ll check her diaper, burp her, rock her, nurse her, but she just won\u2019t stop crying some times. Then sometimes she wants to nurse but while she\u2019s nursing she won\u2019t calm down so I change positions and try to make her comfortable and we will eventually get it or she\u2019ll just fall asleep. But most of the time I can\u2019t get her to fall asleep unless she falls asleep while nursing.\nI\u2019ve been handing it pretty okay but last night was the worst night because I tried to get her to sleep in her bassinet again and I didn\u2019t give in. I would rock her or nurse her to sleep every time she woke up and wait around 15-20 minutes before putting her in the bassinet and every time besides once she woke up immediately. She\u2019s been awake since 6:40 pm last night. She\u2019s fought her sleep so bad but has fallen asleep off and on but nothing more than 30 minutes at a time.\nI haven\u2019t had any sleep, I\u2019m not able to eat all the time, and I\u2019m on the couch almost 24/7 because she won\u2019t let me do anything other than hold her.\nWhen she was in the nicu she slept in the crib there she did wake up a few times before her scheduled feedings but she was so good in there until the last day I spent all day with her and every time I\u2019d put her in her crib she started crying and wouldn\u2019t calm down. So now we are where we are.\n\nWhat advice do you mamas have on colicky babies? What did you do to get your babies to sleep on there own?\n\nI\u2019m supper blessed and still just as excited for her to be here as I was the first day. And even while she\u2019s stressing me out and screaming I\u2019m still looking at her and smiling and laughing at how cute she is. I love her so much but I\u2019m sooo tired and will try anything to get her to sleep in her own.\n\nI\u2019m going to let her sleep with me for a few hours this morning and start doing it again today since I haven\u2019t had any sleep at all. But I don\u2019t want to confuse her by letting her sleep with me again. But if I don\u2019t I won\u2019t get any sleep.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice at all! And thank you I\u2019m advance!",

You can tell by her hands, if her hands are relaxed after eating than she\u2019s full if they\u2019re still clenched she\u2019s not full. Also, she could be cluster feeding and pacifying herself in you and I know it\u2019s exhausting. My daughter is almost 6 months old and I\u2019m her pacifier. You can also try meeting with a lactation consultant to see if she\u2019s getting a good deep latch. My daughter not being able to latch properly is what has caused her colic. Baby wearing, and skin to skin might also help her get calm down and get some sleep. Hang in there momma, you\u2019re doing great!",

				"text": "I remember those days like it was yesterday! Those first few weeks are so hard on both mama and baby. Babies are just so new to the world and are just confused, so you\u2019re their safe place. My little boy was the same way, I would have to hold him all day and co slept until 6 months old (which was my choice I could\u2019ve stopped earlier but didn\u2019t want to.) But he was super colicky and wanted to nurse 24/7 those first 10/11 weeks, then after that it just got so much better. Just know that you\u2019re doing a great job and doing the best that you can right now for baby. Sometimes I would take mine outside and he would instantly stop crying it was crazy how it worked. So I would start taking him on walks everyday and it helped me so much too just getting outside and not being on the couch all day. Also, try a swaddle. My little boy loved a swaddle that used to be the only way I could lay him down when he was that little. Sending you love and prayers through this time, but just know that it does get better! \u2764\ufe0f",

I couldn\u2019t move that much and so she slept on me and when she\u2019s not, she\u2019s on my husband\u2019s arms - i ignored all the noises that told me that it was dangerous/not recommended/\netc. i didn\u2019t care bc I needed to rest to heal. My advice: baby wearing, and accept that some babies are just gonna need more lovin\u2019 in their mama\u2019s arms than others. I sometimes will wear my sling and let her sleep on me while I lay down bc I need to rest too, and the sling will just help to hold her kind of in place so I don\u2019t drop her. Mine is just over a month old and hubby and I wear her all the time bc she will cry if she\u2019s put down for too long (even at diaper change station). Plus I think she\u2019s too little to be able soothe herself so you\u2019re gonna have to help her, a lot. I just accepted that about mine and my stress level has gone down, I don\u2019t get that much more sleep but at least I\u2019m not as frustrated. And I\u2019m also hoping that there is light at the end of the tunnel, just gotta keep going, do what works and what\u2019s best for you and her, one day at a time. You\u2019re amazing and she\u2019s beautiful!",

The more you try to put her down while sleeping the longer she will stay asleep as the days pass. It's really tough but just stick with it. The first time my baby fusses she's hungry, and then she's sleepy the next time. She may also be hungry and cluster feeding I won't lie I caved and gave my baby formula to supplement because the same thing was happening with me a month in. After that first time seeing her satisfied and getting more sleep I decided to continue supplementing and I still nurse during the day. It honestly sounds alot like gas as well. Maybe try gas drops? And then it sounds like she's getting overtired as well since she shouldn't be awake very long at a time this young.",

My husband and I took turns during the night sleeping with her on the couch. We got her on medication which helped enough where she would lie on her boppy. I bought a heat pack for her tummy which seemed to help calm her. We took her to a chiropractor who showed us massages to do with her and 2 days later she was sleeping through the night in her bassinet. She'll take 1 nap in her bassinet a day and we are slowly working on the rest, but we are so thankful for the night time sleep. It's hard but does get better! Stay strong mama!",

We are still working on breaking the cycle of contact naps during the day, but at least at night, she gets that she\u2019s supposed to sleep in her bassinet. Besides the reflux medicine, for the first several times of her sleeping on her own, I would keep my hand on her lower belly which really soothes her, and did gentle pats on her side for several minutes while she laid in the bassinet.

I was in my couch all the time, holding her at all times, I\u2019d go pee while still holding her. It\u2019s just hard but you\u2019re doing amazing!\nI suggest to keep cosleeping of course be careful, get a bed for her to put in your bed so she has her own safe space. She probably just wants you, she\u2019s still freshly out the womb \ud83e\udd70 that way you\u2019ll get at least a few hours to sleep in between feds while she sleeps. Get a rolling cart caddy and have everything you need next to your bed and stay in your room with dim light or just the room dark if possible.\nFor colicky baby I bought gripe water and gave her as needed and also mylicon drops (I think is called) they work AMAZING! Also do massages with her legs so she can let gas out and also make sure you\u2019re burping her, s\u00faper important.\n\nThings will get better soon, for now just worry about having a healthy baby and for you to also be ok \ud83d\ude0a\n\nPicture of the little bed my husband bought for our daughter to put in our bed. She\u2019s now 4 months and she doesn\u2019t sleep in it anymore but we use it a lot for outdoors, so we put her in there if we are in a picnic area or if It happens to need a diaper change in the car, sometimes restaurants don\u2019t have a family bathroom or a changing table for babies so it\u2019s been super useful",

One thing that I did with my oldest son and will be doing soon with my second (when we move him to his own room) is the crib hammock. I got the one that is mesh material so if they turn their head or somehow figured out how to roll at all (I don\u2019t know how they possibly would) they could still breathe. This is what took my oldest from waking up 2-3 times a night to sleeping through the entire night, every night. With proper installation, this also took away my worry of him rolling over and not being able to breathe. Best of look to you, Mama!! I hope you find what works for you!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9a",

We\u2019re using the nested bean. It\u2019s supposed to feel as if they have moms hand on them 3. Gripe water 4. Gas drops after feeds 5. Probiotics for baby 6. Digestive enzymes for mama if breastfeeding 7. White noise machine 8. Keeping him upright 30min after feeds 9. Elevating a side of the bassinet (we rolled a towel up under one side). We\u2019ve tried all these things and still haven\u2019t found the best solution but every baby is different so maybe one of these will work for you.

I have an 8 week old who is on and off colicky, and she was quite bad the past few days that I eventually had to call backup (sister in law) to hold her while I showered, cooked and had a 2hr nap because I was crying out of exhaustion. It's tough when the little one won't let you put them down... my advice would be to swaddle her (if you don't already) straight after she feeds and then hold her until she's asleep. Then when transferring her to her bassinet, slowly put her down and keep holding her even when her body is on the mattress by leaning over. Once the mattress warms up a little slowly move your hands out. This seems to work on my baby. The process takes me about 10min but she has been able to stay asleep, and has recently started sleeping 5-6hrs on her own. As I said earlier, it does get better.\nHang in there mama, you're amazing for keeping her comfortable on you day and night.",

Our second night in the hospital, during a 4.5 hour breast feeding session, our little one screamed like I\u2019ve never heard her scream still to this day. Like she was in pain. Every time I\u2019d pull her off the boob a couple seconds later she was wailing. I finally called in a nurse after 4.5 hours of trying to breast feed her and asked for some formula. We gave her a little bit and she immediately fell asleep and was asleep for a couple hours. I got home and started pumping and tried EVERYTHING that\u2019s recommended for breast milk supply and I just have never had enough supply to fully feed her. So we were supplementing with formula. Now we\u2019re basically just all formula. But it could totally be why your little one is fussing all the time. Mine was like that for the first week until I started pumping and realized I wasn\u2019t making nearly enough to keep her fed and happy throughout the day.",

						"text": "Nicole Lefever the way I can tell if she\u2019s getting full is she pulls away and falls asleep, but when she wants to self soothe she\u2019s more slowly sucking and almost not even sucking just keeping my boob in her mouth. But I\u2019m definitely trying to pump more to have extra milk handy for bottle feeds and I\u2019m hoping that helps a little. I started pumping again yesterday and I was getting more milk than I thought I would with her nursing as much as she does. My boobs also leak ALOT \ud83e\udd74. But I try to keep lactation snacks near me on the couch and I drink a lot of body armor drinks so maybe it helps what mlst the food I do eat is food that is known to help boost milk supply. I also have been cutting my dairy back to see if it helps with her stomach the only thing I haven\u2019t cut is coffee creamer but the next time I\u2019m able to buy groceries I\u2019m going to get a almond milk creamer and see if it helps any!

As for sleeping in the bassinet make sure the mattress is warm before placing her down so either warm it up with your hand , place a Luke warm hot water bottle on it then remove before lying babe down. Also placing a t shirt you wore the day before or the one you wore in the morning around the mattress tucking in any loose bits so it has your sent on it. Or sleep with a bassinet sheet the night before and put it on the mattress. Also was the crib in the hospital on a tilt by any chance?",

				"text": "First of all, you\u2019re doing amazing so hang in there mama! FTM as well with 3 month old who was very gassy the first month and a half until he learned to poop on his own (then we switched him to formula and we\u2019re learning things all over again). My LO was exactly the same, he would self soothe on the boob whenever he hd to poop so that the milk pushed down whatever was inside and he would overeat then puke. Add to that the all night grunting etc. No advice on that end except for the biogaia drops which helped him pass stools easier and the colic gripe water which now helps soothe him from gassy formula. For cosleeping, we also did the same until about 7 weeks. Had him in the Snuggle Me between us in a king bed and had the Nanit camera on for monitoring vitals. He hated the bassinet, the snoo, the bouncer etc. He loves his crib though. Some babies just do better with the transitioning to the crib directly. We have his crib in our room and sleep better now. And as for the swing, babies are different. They adjust slowly. Our LO just recently started playing in his bouncer at 2 months because before that he could barely recognize the objects and wanted to feel safe on mommy or daddy. Sorry I can\u2019t provide solid advice but it does pass. The world is so new for them. Just forget about house looking perfect and clean, and if you have financial means order out for another month or so during the week or get your spouse to help out. We had to hire a cleaner and my spouse cooks so that\u2019s how we managed. I was the same way, couldn\u2019t even shower most days. Or if I needed to, would get up really early before my husband went to work and got him to look after the baby for 10 min so I could shower.",

My guy got better as soon as he was rolling (circa 5 months).

Take steps and stay.\nTalk to babe once getting fussy. Mommy's right here. Your safe. It's time to sleep. Mom will be here when you wake up. Or I'm staying home. You sleep. Idk something. And just keep it up. Maybe this will go on for hours and for a few days. Every sleep time. Every nap. Every bedtime. Every day. All day. For a few days to a week!\n\nIdk on the colicky thing. Um, does she do best when she's \"sitting\" up or like laying kinda up? If it's colic that's like gas, upset stomach, ect. Right? After eating with reflux some have better time keeping them sitting up for a while.\nRub tummy. Try and Xtra burp. Of course gas drops and gripe water. And make sure doesn't need to poo, doing bicycle legs and bring knees up to chest pausing there, and then pull legs all the way out and pause. So tht slowly. Um. Warmth on the belly. Warm baths. Massaging belly.\n\nGoof luck dear! \u2764\ufe0f",

				"text": "It sounds like you wrote this about my son. He's almost 3 months. I intended on exclusively breastfeeding with some pumping so that my husband could give a bottle and bond with baby. My milk never really came in. I'm still only producing a half ounce to an ounce every 2-3 hours/feeding. We supplement with 3 ounces of formula. Until we figured that out my son would cry and be inconsolable. I would pump a few times when someone else can hold the baby just to see how much you're actually producing. My son wants to be held 24/7. We tried swaddling but he was like Houdini and would always escape. He wanted to have his arms out and be free to move. Once he was 8 lbs (he was born at 7lbs 2oz but then lost weight while we figured out I wasn't producing enough) we got a Dreamland weighted sleep sack. The pediatrician also recommended putting a folded towel under his mattress to help with reflux and Mylicon for gas. Now he sleeps 5-6 hours straight in his bassinet. Naps are another story. We don't use the sleepsack for naps because I don't want to confuse his days and nights and undo the progress we've made with night time sleep. If he falls asleep anywhere other than someone's arms (bassinet, carseat, swing, Momaroo) for a nap, he will sleep a max of 30 min. If he falls asleep in your arms and you try to put him down, he wakes up immediately or within a few minutes. He fights sleep so for now I'm still holding him. He tends to sleep longer and deeper when I do. I think the fact that I have to hold him all the time definitely affected my supply. I don't have a chance to eat or drink the way I should or pump for that matter. I didn't want to drink too much because then I'd have to pee and wake up my son or try to hold it until he woke up from his nap (up to 2 hours) and be uncomfortable. When my husband went back to work, I try to keep snacks available that I can eat with one hand - sippable soup, trail mix, granola, granola bars, string cheese, baby carrots, yogurt tubes, Pop Tarts. When he wakes up from a nap, he is usually hungry. I put him in the bassinet for a minute, use the bathroom, get his bottle and my snack and/or drink, change him, feed him, and then eat while he is doing something I don't need to hold him for (playmat, swing, Momaroo or during a drive/walk). Hope this helps.",

But a baby can\u2019t do anything for themselves and have spent all their time growing inside you so of course they look for comfort and connection. Nothing wrong with growing your bond.

No reason for him to unnecessarily cry if I have the ability to comfort him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs for tummy time, our baby boy hated it too until we got some floor toys to make it fun.

When they get older and your sleep training that's different or if your about to break and need a moment yes it fine for baby to cry while you take a moment that's totally different than letting them cry it out to cry it out .",

I was in a really bad place for the first few weeks after my hubby went back to work where I wasn't looking after myself properly (not eating properly, feeling like I wasn't getting anything else done, always stuck on the sofa with him etc) because all I was worried about was him and his needs, which is of course important, but we're so important too. Without us they couldn't survive full stop! I'm not going to let him cry through the night as then he'll become unsettled and won't go down again for ages, and we're in a really good sleep routine now so don't want to spoil that. Basically what I'm saying is so long as you know baby is safe, you don't need to rush to them as soon as they start crying, a few tears and wails won't hurt them for a couple of minutes while you sort yourself out!",

If she's in bed, I usually just give her her dummy then lay her back down and pat her back to sleep if she needs it. During the day, if she wants me and is crying, I will pick her up. Babys don't have the brain development until about 6 for self regulation. Therefore they need co regulation. They need you to help them calm their little bodies. If my baby wants me, and I can pick her up then I will. Granted sometimes if I'm cooking dinner or something, I will say, \"sorry baby, I hear you are upset and want to be picked up but mama has dirty hands right now but I'll be with you in two minutes\" then follow through with that.",

				"text": "My baby is also 2.5 months (born April 8th) I found using a pillow and leaning him against it made him enjoy tummy time more and now he\u2019s strong enough to do it pretty well so recently we got a little Matt that you fill with water and I\u2019ve been having him do tummy time on there and he sees the little fishes in it move around as he moves. So it\u2019s kept him on his tummy longer than anything else I had tried lol. Also I know if you have him on you and he\u2019s lifting his head and stuff that\u2019s also considered tummy time. My older son was a fan of that. I would lay him between my legs so he was laying on my stomach but had his knees on the bed and he would hang like that for a good 20mins just talking to me and looking around.\n\nAs far as spoiling a baby, I\u2019ve been told that over and over so here\u2019s my experience with it (having had a 2nd child now) with my first I was only 19 so I listened to everything and my mother always told me you can\u2019t spoil so I held my son constantly. When awake. When asleep. Always. He ended up very clingy as a toddler and wouldn\u2019t sleep without me touching him (usually holding his hand the older he got) but this lasted for years. He was probably 5 before he would just go in his room and go to sleep without my hand. Now my new baby is 2.5 months and he\u2019s so different. I can lay him down and he will lay there and then get himself to sleep often times. I decided with him I will of course hold him and all of that when I need to. And of course tend to his needs but not hold him all day while he\u2019s sleeping etc like I did with my first. And it\u2019s made such a difference. I feel like he\u2019s a happier baby not feeling he needs that constant attention. Seems like he feels more confident to just hang out. That\u2019s just my experience. My boys are 16 years apart in age.",

But my third baby is still breastfeeding as my other 2 didn\u2019t make it past 3 months. He sleeps terribly! All night long he\u2019s kicking his feet and flailing his arms around. Constantly whining and crying. If I don\u2019t latch him he will continue to cry. I\u2019ve tried a burts bees lightly weighted sack and that does no good. I\u2019ve even given him a full bottle right before bed rather than nursing and it didn\u2019t change anything. He\u2019s been like this for probably the last 4-5 months. What am I doing wrong? Is he in pain? Or does he just use me as comfort? And how can I change that. Thank you in advance! Picture of my little turd \u2763\ufe0f",

				"text": "Our 6.5 month old was the same way, we have been bed sharing since about 5.5 months because he woke up every 45 mins to 1 hr ...even at night. Up until yesterday he was using me as a pacifier.\n\nYesterday, I couldn't handle the lack of sleep anymore. What's worse is tha it was affecting his sleep too. He wasn't sleeping well because he was constantly looking to relatch as soon as he detached. This was on and off all night long.\n\nSo, at first I tried something I saw on the internet where the parent stays by the cot without engaging. The only time the baby was picked up was if he was really too distressed (put down again as soon as the crying stopped) or lay him down if he tried to pull himself up using the cot walls.\n\nThis really didn't work because my LO was too distressed and it broke my heart.\n\nInstead I placed him onto our bed with bed rails up and laid next to him (facing him). White noise on, covered my chest area with my left arm I patted his bum with my right hand until he fell asleep.\n\nHe cried for 20 mins but then fell asleep (I feel this very was fine as he knew I was right there with him). This was nap 1. It got progressively faster each time.\n\nHe woke up after 4 hrs last night to feed and then went to bed without searching for me to comfort himself.\n\nToday is day 2 and he doesn't cry anymore, just grumbles. It takes about 4 mins and he's asleep and I can roll off the bed.\n\nThis way is so much kinder to both of us as I am right next to him so he knows I haven't abandoned him.\n\nAfter doing this for 2 weeks I think we will try the method of patting his bum while in his cot. Hopefully it will be a big enough habit that it works in there too. If not that's fine as I like co sleeping as long as he isn't constantly waking up looking for my breast or worse crying because he wants me pick him up and walk him around the room\n\nYou have no idea how relaxed I am for naps and bedtime now. I am so shocked and hopefull that sleep will be going back to normal again soon \ud83e\udd17",

		"text": "Looking for advice to keep my almost 9 week old asleep for his naps. I try to follow the guidelines for the \u201cwake windows\u201d and as soon as I notice he starts to just stare off or starts rubbing his eyes and yawning I start our routine for naps.\ufffc I take him in his room where it is dark, turn on his sound machine get him in his swaddle and\ufffc Hold him to get him to start to fall asleep. I\u2019ve tried laying him down drowsy that doesn\u2019t work, he almost starts to startle himself or make himself cry to wake himself. I tried rocking him until he is fully asleep after 10 to 15 minutes and laying him down and he last for maybe five minutes and starts screaming. Today I tried laying him down without a swaddle and laying him on his side and tummy.\n\nSometimes he can go 3 to 5 hours without sleeping during the day and he is absolutely miserable and overtired. \ufffcHe sleeps fine at night though. he goes down around 830/9 and will sleep until 7 with uninterrupted sleep. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc he still sleeps in a bassinet but he\u2019s getting too big for it. He will sleep on me or in my arms for hours but he will not sleep if he is being laid down. \ufffcAlso I go back to work tomorrow and my mother-in-law will be watching him. I just want him to be able to take normal naps in his crib. \ufffc\ufffc\n\nHe was just put on Pepcid for reflux\ufffc and he does have a dairy intolerance. Not sure if these would affect his naps but I am just looking for any possible insight that anyone can give. I cannot get anything done during the day because I feel like I cannot put him down. I\u2019ve tried letting him cry it out and he can cry it out\ufffc for 40 minutes and still keep going \ud83d\ude29 it\u2019s just getting to be so exhausting.",

				"text": "Hi Alicia McNulty. Sleep consultant here - at 9 weeks, your baby has just 2 sleep cycles, active (light) and quiet (deep). If you try putting babies down during active sleep, they wake up almost immediately. If you wait about 20 mins until they\u2019ve passed into quiet sleep, they are able to be moved without waking and can sleep through ambient noise. You might also try putting him down in the bassinet (or crib), holding a firm hand on his chest and shhing to help him fall asleep. If he\u2019s not overtired, he should be able to fall asleep with minimal fussing. Good luck! Let me know if you want to chat further about newborn sleep patterns. Feel free to PM me!",

They've slept through the night since 13 months.\nWe've gone through sleep regressions but nothing as bad as right now.\n\nFor the last three weeks one if our girls\n- Doesn't want to go to sleep without one of us present. Even then it will take up to an hour until she is finally asleep. We are having meltdowns every night.\n- She wakes up after one sleep cycle. 9pm each night she'll be in our bedroom. She'll sleep in our bed or there's another meltdown.\n\nShe also refuses baths all of a sudden.\n\nIf we refuse to sit with her, she'll try to sleep in her sister's bed. Which leads to her sister having a meltdown.\n\nWe had a good thing going.\nThey would fall asleep independently, no night wake ups. No drama at bedtime.\n\nWe have changed nothing.\nBedtime is 6.30pm, wake up at about 6am.\nBedtime routine is the same. They were on one nap but we asked nursery to cut it, so meltdowns in the evening are at a minimum because she's too tired.\n\nWe honestly don't know what to do. We have no time for us anymore. My husband sleeps in the guest room.\n\nWe don't know what to do and really need help.",

When we would read I learned to read in a soft tone nothing exciting and as I\u2019m reading to him my words are getting slower with time. Him not having to go to sleep (in his mind) took away the anxiety for bedtime he had started having and the reading the book in this way helped him wind down. We didn\u2019t do songs after reading as I felt like he would get hyper again if we did lol (he was a very active little guy, he\u2019s now 16yrs old) good luck to you! I hope you find something that helps! Hang in there!!",

We have continued naps because he still needs them, (super cranky when he doesn\u2019t get one) and we might just be getting through it, though I\u2019m sure I just jinxed myself, haha. One thing that seemed to help him was to being a friend to sleep. He had phased through having a stuffed animal to bring to bed, but bringing it back recently seemed to help him. He hugs it, sings to it and that helps him \u201cgo through his bedtime by himself\u201d, if that makes sense. We do his bedtime, but we notice he sings, reads and cuddles with a stuffed animal again. He\u2019s in such an independent stage anyway, maybe it makes him feel like bedtime is his choice. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We are going with it for now.

His crib is also in my room so I hear every noise he makes. I feel safe and comfortable with using this but to each their own. However, I would never use this in my bed with co sleeping. I feel the dockatot and snuggle me type things are less safe than this.",

Yesterday she slept on her tummy for over an hour before wanting to be rolled over (I checked the camera history haha)",

But we\u2019re also moving to the crib so I\u2019m hoping he might wean himself once in there.\n\nOurs just started rolling too! I\u2019ve left him until he starts crying.

One thing I would recommend doing is bath bottle bed at the same time every night. White noise if u havnt already tried that. And maybe an extra ounce in the bed time bottle too. Maybe he\u2019s hungry still he\u2019s a big boy like mine and that\u2019s what I did for him he slept like a dream before teething. Also told someone else on here to do that and the next day she messaged saying he slept through the night good luck \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",

Took a few days maybe a week or so of letting her cry for a bit, soothing but not picking her back up & putting the pacifier back in when she dropped it. I was shocked when I was so exhausted I just put her in the crib & she fell asleep on her own. I couldn\u2019t believe it lol, now every nap and bedtime we get her in her sleep suit and place her in the crib with white noise and no lights and she\u2019s out within a few minutes, she\u2019ll whine a bit or kick her leg to self soothe but that\u2019s about it. If you\u2019re feeding them to sleep you should try to break that habit. I followed the \u201cput them down awake but drowsy\u201d . I used to rock her to sleep every single time and it was just exhausting, but every baby is different and it takes patience, don\u2019t give up",

He naps after that for about 4 hours, stays awake for another 4 hours, and than in that timing it's bath time again..

I make sure I feed my 3 month old every 3-4 hours during the day so he doesn't feel like he needs to catch on up eating at night. We have the same routines during the day I give him plenty of Tummy time, play, fresh air/sun outside and brain stimulation to tire him out. He takes 1-3 naps a day. Then around 8pm we settle down, do quite time, he gets his last feeding, a clean diaper, body & face wiped down, clean clothes, I put him in a sleep sack, turn his sound machine on then I rock him to sleep after that i transfer him to his crib. He sleeps 10 hours through the night bed time to morning. I never tried to sleep train him, I just kept up a routine and around 1-1\u00bd months he started sleeping through the night. He knows once quite time starts and we start our night time routine that it's time for bed.",

Bedtime is Bath, lotion&massage,\nchange, nurse, bed. He also has the same sound machine since he was born too and he loves his sound machine, he knows it's sleep time when it gets turned on. He has no issues going down at all in his crib, just still wakes every 3-4 hours to eat. He will go to sleep right after he eats but I've gotten a handful of 5-7 hour stretches so I know he can go longer and I know he will be a much happier baby if he did.",

My friend weened her baby off night time feedings by doing that (it happened for me by accident lol) also when he wakes up instead of feeding immediately try to sooth by shushing and putting your hand on his chest so he knows your there, if he won't settle in his crib back to sleep, try picking him up and rocking him to sleep. If all that fails obviously feed him. I would just keep doing that till he gets weened off of night time feedings or it goes to just one feeding in the middle of the night instead of many for you sanity.",

		"text": "Hey y\u2019all, I feel like this needs to be said because I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts about sleep training at a VERY young age, moms upset because of their babies waking up so often, the whole works! Mind you- everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you can agree to disagree with me, this is NOT me mom shaming or coming at anyone, this is coming from a place of love and support, and whether you decide to take this advice or not is totally up to you!\n\u2022Newborns usually are going to wake often. Their tummies are so small and for about the first 6 weeks, they just want to bond with you, and be reassured they have that trust and security with you.\n\u2022if you are concerned they\u2019re waking up more than they should or can\u2019t seem to settle after you put them back to sleep, look into reflux, gas, food sensitivities, tongue ties, or their sleep environment (temp of room, dark or too much light, white noise, what they\u2019re sleeping in/on, etc)\n\u2022some will argue sleep training is acceptable at all ages. From things I have read, researched, and the multiple professional opinions I have gotten, sleep training is only beneficial starting as young as 4 months, when your baby is able to differentiate days and nights, connect sleep cycles, produce natural melatonin, and have an established bond with mom/dad.\n\u2022there are quite a few different sleep training methods, CIO is not your only option!! I urge y\u2019all to Google and read up on the different methods because what works for one baby might not work for yours!\nMotherhood is none the less exhausting. It brings out the best and the worst in us. Please know if you feel you are at your wits end, it is 100% okay to put baby in a safe spot and take a breather. We are only human, it\u2019s okay to feel the emotions I\u2019m sure all of us do and have felt.\nSeriously, Google has been my best friend, the pediatrician\u2019s office knows me on a first name basis, my mom is probably on the verge of blocking my number because I call her SO much lol, and I have probably ordered about 5 different books and read them all twice. Don\u2019t get discouraged about posts you see, every baby is different! Mine was sleeping through the night and then in an instant I got humbled with the notorious \u27284 month sleep regression\u2728 it happens!! Everyone drink some water and hang in there lol",

There\u2019s tooonnnss of sleep training techniques that are baby friendly that work just as well. Our baby is 4.5 months and hit the regression a few weeks ago. Our doctor gave us advice that\u2019s works amazing! I breastfeed and put to bed at her regular bedtime (8:30-9), then wake for a top off feed right before I go to sleep (10-10:30) and we\u2019ve stretched out until 4-5am before needing another feed then back to sleep until 7:30am. We only wake once a night which is great, no crying required, and our hope is that she will eventually cut out the 4am wake once she no longer needs night feeds.",

He slept through the night Sunday but here we are and he had a full diaper and a warm bottle and back to sleep. I only get this 1x so I just embrace it.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is when \"friends\" tell me, let him cry it out or you'll spoil him by going to him when he cries.

And like you said some methods might work for your baby but not for others but it\u2019s good to share what works for you and it might help someone else. Mums/dads don\u2019t be so hard on yourselves we\u2019re all going through or have been through some tough times with our tiny humans but it does get easier (until they start to talk \ud83d\ude02 jk) you should all be proud for seeking advice no shame in it whatsoever just please don\u2019t judge one another or tell another mum they shouldn\u2019t be doing it that way unless it\u2019s super unsafe of course. Let\u2019s all just enjoy our babies they are not small for very long at all my first born will be a teenager in September and some nights she doesn\u2019t sleep lol the newborn stages are the most stressful for sleeping as we\u2019re use to a full nights sleep but it\u2019s only for a short time just ride it would and let your baby BE a baby sleep schedules i think they baby makes there own on that one lol they wake up when they need something and some babies don\u2019t even need alot of sleep you need to learn what they need could be literally anything from a tummy ache, reflux, over tired or they just simply want to be close to you. Whatever it is just stay calm take a deep breath and try something you may not have tried before even giving them a warm bath helps x",

				"text": "Well said. So many parents putting unnecessary pressure on themselves to have this perfect little baby when it's all just an illusion. Babies live by their own schedule until they are past 6 months. Some baby's can follow routine but even then there are always hiccups.\nI see alot of posts upset that someone else's baby sleeps all night from 3 weeks blah blah. Well every baby is different. They all have different sleep needs and some are more laid back than others.\nI have 3 daughters, all raised the same with same sleep techniques\nDaughter 1 woke up every 2 hours for the first 18 months. Cried alot but went to sleep well and needed lots of attention(aged 18 now and still hypo)\nDaughter 2 slept through the night from 7pm to 7am from 3 weeks. Most laid back ever( now aged 14 and still the most laid back little girl ever)\nDaughter 3 aged 5 weeks now. Very hard to get to sleep and requires hours of rocking, bouncing and walking the house. Wakes every 2 hours. Needs holding all day lol\n\nIt's just their personality and needs. You can read 1 million things on here and it won't change the fact your baby had their own individual needs.\nRelax, follow your babies cues, embrace their personality and needs and stop trying to fit them into a text book box.\nThey grow up so so quick.\nTake each day as it comes and don't forget that you can put them down and go to your room for a minute if you need to relax",

At night if he\u2019s asleep he\u2019ll go 3-4 before waking up for a bottle. Is it something I\u2019m doing wrong as to why he\u2019s eating every 2 hours still or is that ok?\n\nHe also fights his sleep so much. He\u2019ll nap during the day after bottles, but not very well and at night sometimes he\u2019s up for hours not wanting to sleep or having trouble getting into a deep sleep.\n\nWe\u2019re currently not on any set schedule, we just go by when he\u2019s tired/hungry and let him tell us what he needs. Mainly because idk how to get a baby on a schedule? Lol if he\u2019s not tired at a nap time or is tired when it isn\u2019t what do I do? Lastly, how do I help him differentiate between a nap and bedtime?\n\nSorry if these questions seem silly I\u2019m just at such a loss because again, I\u2019m a first time mom and he was in the nicu until almost 4 weeks so it feels like I missed out on establishing things early. \ud83d\ude1e TIA",

All i can suggest is learning your baby's sleep cues and start putting them down for naps so you don't develope a habit of letting him get overtired. Literally putting them in their crib or bassinet to sleep is good too, for some of the times so they can get used to it. Biggest mistake I think I made with my girl (16 weeks now) was holding her. ALL. THE. TIME. I loved every second. We just started sleep training and it is hell. Hell going from jumping to their every cry immediately then all of a sudden not.

Make sure your little one gets outside a good amount during the day. The sun on his skin will help him establish a day/night schedule. I tried to stick to the normal wake periods during the day with naps too. Then around seven-ish in the evening, we do a bath (don\u2019t use soap everyday, but warm water feels good), oil his skin and do a little massage, then let him play and sing a little song to him or whatever sounds good to you, and then I rock him to sleep. If he wakes up and it has been two hours or more, I fed him in a dark quiet room and rocked him back to sleep. He started to stretch out his feedings and got the hang of it. He fluctuates some one waking, but it is usually once or twice a night now. Good luck. You are doing great. My baby hates to go to sleep, but I have gotten better at putting him down and knowing when and how to get him to sleep. He is 5 months now.",

If he goes last that it\u2019s much more difficult for him to get to sleep. We have followed a routine since he was about 3 weeks old. And that seems to have helped my guy (my first son I never had a routine knew nothing of wake windows and he was so much harder to get to sleep) I also have since 2 weeks old swaddled him for naps and night time sleep so when he\u2019s ready and getting tired I swaddle him then feed him and it seems to let him know it\u2019s time for sleep. I also have a sound machine that I do lullabies on for naps and white noise for bed time. I feel like doing bath time routine and the white noise let\u2019s him know it\u2019s time for sleep at night. Also right at 7 weeks my guy was still eating every 2hrs and I was given advice to just fit an extra ounce in with his feeding and it made such a difference! So that could help as well as just setting a solid routine to show sleep time from wake time.",

He goes down for contact naps and will nap sometime in his bassinet. Around 6 I start to wind down not as much play. Close blinds lower sounds so he can get ready for night. He will go completely down for the night at 8pm he will eat every 3hrs still but go back to sleep. The longest he went at night is 6hrs no bttle and that\u2019s the longest i will allow it to go.",

We do a bath (soap only once a week), lotion, pajamas and and I rock him to sleep with a bottle (we don't do that for naps-he eats when he wakes from a nap not before). Once we started doing this he dropped his first night feed and sleeps about 6 hours straight ever since! Black out curtains, sound machine, and a swaddle.\nMy son also eats every 2 hours during the day because he goes longer stretches at night.

				"text": "Your little guy might be a bit hungry, maybe up the feed amount a little and see if he goes a longer stretch but each baby is different and a 2- 3 hour stretch is about right at this stage. If he vomits a lot after upping the feed then he has probably over eaten.. babies are piggies and will sometimes just eat because it's on offer. Also see if baby is maybe confusing night time with day time. I make sure my baby's room is very dark at night and very light in the day so he knows the difference. In the morning I open the curtains and switch on a radio for some extra background noise and i speak and interact with him during feeds and nappy changes and I don't swaddle in the daytime. At night I swaddle and switch off the radio. I also don't speak or Interact with him during the night feeds and changes so he doesn't think its time to be awake and alert. I don't use a lot of light, only a small white camping light to see during nappy changes and then I have a red camping light which is less disturbing for baby which I use just so see the basics in the night. At night I feed my son in his cot, I sit him up and feed him his bottle and burp in the same position. When he was a newborn I found that the ritual of taking him out of the cot to a feeding chair and then feeding and burping left him too awake after a feed on the middle of the night which resulting in spending time trying to put him back to sleep which meant even less sleep for me. With the cot feeding I am able to feed him and lay him back down in the warmth of his cot, swaddle and leave the room. He chats to himself for a short while and then goes back to sleep. When i change his nappy In the night I do it in the middle of the feed so he has the rest of the bottle to come back to before I swaddle for sleep again. This is probably all unconventional and against the 'rules' but it's what works for me. The main thing is for you to figure out what works for you - even if it seems weird. Try different things until it works. You are doing a super job, just keep at it. Good Luck! Xx",

It\u2019s all in a frustrated way so after a few hours I\u2019ve become emotionally exhausted with that and the crying on top being pretty tired because of the time. Nobody likes to get screamed and whined at for hours, especially for consecutive days. He\u2019s not very crabby during the day so its a negative shift at the end of every day. I use all my energy to stay calm and soothing so I don\u2019t make him worse. We have good days. Today I\u2019m just tired and dreading tonight so I feel the way I do.

		"text": "Hi all, very tired mum, looking for some advice!\nMy little girl Arwen is 4 months old (3 months adjusted age) she has never been a good sleeper. She has always resisted naps- the longest naps she's had is around 45 mins and stretch of sleep she's had through the night is around 3-4hours. She's breast fed during the day and night and bottle fed with breastmilk in the early evening by my husband. Her routine is: awake, fed, changed, massage, dress and play at 08:00, I try my best to get her to nap around 09:30/10:00 when she is acting tired but she either resists completely or does a micro contact nap. If she does nap she will not be put down awake, I have to transfer her from me into her Moses basket. I then try the same routine around lunchtime when she seems tired again (12/13:00ish after being fed, changed, play etc.) And again around 15:30/16:00. At around 18:00 she is fed then gets a lavender bath at 18:30. She then gets a lavender lotion massage and is fed again with a bedtime story. Up until about 2 weeks ago she would scream with colic for an hour at this point but be asleep by 8pm and sleep until a dream feed at midnight then 03:30 and again at 05:30. She would breastfeed, need changed and go back to sleep pretty easily during wake-ups. But now she is screaming for hours, asleep by 9pm, wakes around 3 times before midnight and is up every 2 hours. She also is harder to get back to sleep. At nighttime the room is dark with red light, an ok temperature, she has lush sleepy spray in her crib and white noise playing all night. She sleeps in a normal babygrow with a light tog sleep bag as she's very warm blooded like us! She sleeps in her co sleeper crib next to the bed. She's never been a big eater and is small however is following her curve. The paediatrician says she is a snacker but is very efficient on the boob (can get 2-3 ounces out in the 5 mins she latches) she also only drinks 2-3 ounces at a time from the bottle. She's great at self soothing with sucking her thumb, doesn't use a dummy and hates being swaddled including the Merlin magic suit. I personally would like to wait until the 4 month sleep regression is over with before sleep training and don't agree with the crying it out method. She has silent reflux which she has infant gaviscon for in case its relevant. I realise this is a rant but any advice is much appreciated. We are so tired and know that she needs the sleep as much as us! Thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

				"text": "I didn't read everything, I got a good away thru. Up to saying she wake 3 times before midnight, so I went back to see the age and yupp my thought lines up with age. Your going thru a sleep regression babe. The 4 month one. So all this is normal.\n\nSorry to hear!\n\nI think Ferbers Method would help you. You do you bedtime routine. Amd you do all the things you normally do. Then feed her. And when just about asleep I lay down. Well, with.my son I would let him fall to sleep and then lay him down. And he would open his eyes and wake for few moments but hopefully at least the goal is for them to close them again and drift off.\nHowever, when he starts crying. You wait 3 mins the 1st night the 1st time. Rhen go in and check on babe. You leave them down. And don't pick them up mostly. Some mommas I've seen them say they do actually pick up their babe. But so, then you sooth and calm.down. and lay them down for bed and leave, then you wait for them to ve crying 5mins.\nAnd repeat the same process.\nAnd again at 8mon.\nAnd 12mon and 15mins. And ect.\nI lean in over crib rails and love on him he tends to stand ans I just lean in and love on him. I kiss his head and pat his bum and rub his back. And I same simple short phrases for him to start associating to sleep with.\n\nThen over the night if he wakes I will feed unless it's ridiculous the amount of time he hasn't let gone by after his last feed or something alike. Once fed, or not feed, and laid back down, and sleeping for a period of time to indicate has gone to bed. Then, if he wakes and crys again,, I start up again with Ferbers, starting at 5min for the 1st time and going in to try and calm him. And then repeat w adding in 3 mins or however you choose to do it\nIt's the Ferbers Method.\nIt's a more gentle CIO way.\n\nAlso! So, babes that wake that frequently I believe have trouble with the transition from the end of 1 sleep cycle and the start of the next sleep cycle. They wake during the transition and then unable to get back to sleep independently.\n\nsleep training is NOT the magic way to get them to sleep thru the night. That IMO, has more to do with day time sleeping hours and wake windows. And alot of babes still need to eat thru the Night. But this helps with that skill of getting back to sleep during the transition of cycles. This will help you both get sleep, and also, will teach them that it's not all fun and games. That this is night and sleep time. You stay strong and you'll both be back on track soon. You got this! \u2764\ufe0f",

That is normal.on her. So tonight I put her to sleep as usual but after 15 min she wakes up screaming like she was in pain, horribly and continously just screaming. After she settled a bit but still screams less and with quiet moments, but is very active taking my hand and moving her leg non stop like you see in the video. The room was dark but I turn the light on to be able.to record the video, and she was actually less active because she saw the phone\nIs this a sleep regression?

However all of these rules have changed over and over throughout the years. They don\u2019t technically know what causes SIDS. They\u2019re guessing to an extent. The suffocation and all of that of course the rules for thing along those lines yes is 100% provable. I was just reading a study last month that the cause of SIDS has recently been linked to an issue in some babies brains at birth that lacks a specific aspect to wake them when they\u2019re in a deep sleep. A deficiency basically and that they\u2019re looking into ways to test for this when babies are born before they leave the hospital and if they\u2019re missing this they are also trying to come up with some sort of way to supplement it so that SIDS doesn\u2019t have a chance to occur. Of course all of those things will take time to develop but they now actually have something solid to go off of to try and to actually fix the issue. In the article it also said because this discovery has been made, parents who have had a baby die of SIDS can stop blaming themselves for it because it\u2019s nothing they did or used that caused it.",

Lol We gave the Ferber method a try last night and it worked okay\u2026.\nMy question is.\nLets say we do checks 3min. 5 min, 10 min, 10 min\nWhat happens after the 4th check in if she don\u2019t stop crying. ?\nWE put her to bed at 6:50pm by 7:40ish she fell asleep. She woke up then at 12;00am did the same 3,5,10,10 she fell asleep until 1:10am\nThen she woke up and the 3,5,10,10 did not work. We got past the last 4th check in and she continued to cry. At this point it was 2:13am.\nSo she\u2019s been crying for an hour at this point.\nI know it says to continue this until 5-7am but I wanted some sleep so bad I took her into my bed. \u2639\ufe0f I don\u2019t want to do this again today ( NIGHT 2) so i would love some tips ? Hopefully this makes sense I\u2019m tired and getting ready for work \ud83e\udd72 lol",

When my girl would do that I would simply place her back in bed when she wasn't actively nursing or swallowing and follow your usual bed routine.\nNight interactions I treat very strict. Absolute minimal light, no talking unless saying our sleep cues like \"shhh, time for bed, goodnight love you\". Keeps them in the zone for sleeping and not to encourage babe crying to get you in the room just to interact or play with",

They say she took a good 3 naps today. From 8am-4:50ishpm. I live 35-40 min from the daycare so she usually takes a nap on the way home and on the way to daycare\nOn weekends she usually sleeps every 2/3 hours. Takes a good 30 min nap. Usually on the car as it\u2019s the summer and we be out and about. Sometimes on her dad sometimes eating.\n\nNow bed time routine she\u2019s had a stable one since birth.\nBath time sometimes not every night.\nBut for sure white noise on, lotion (massage ) Merlin suit and bed. When she was weeks until a month we did swaddle. Now we do the Merlin suit. She gave herself a 7-8pm bedtime since couple weeks old.\nSome days she falls asleep rocked by my husband, ( I\u2019m not around for the bed time routine some night )\nsome days she falls asleep being nursed. I know that I messed up by nursing her to sleep. \ud83d\ude2d\nWe don\u2019t Co-sleep though, we have a guest room so baby girl sleeps on our bed alone ( just an empty bed ) and my husband and I sleep in the guest room. When she would wake up for her night feeds it would be easier for me to just get In her with her feed her and go back to my room rather than picking her up from her crib because it would be some activity happening and it\u2019ll take longer. As I\u2019m writing this I realize that I was on some serious survival mode \ud83e\udd72 haha",

He\u2019s clearly tired still, but if I leave him alone, he grunts and wiggles and cries until he\u2019s wide awake. If I pick him up to rock and soothe him back to sleep, he\u2019ll calm down until he realizes he\u2019s starting to fall asleep\u2026 then he thrashes his head around to wake himself back up. A lactation consultant said try to nurse him between sleep cycles, but I really don\u2019t want to create a \u201dnurse to sleep\u201d association. Any tips?? Do I just have to wait til 4 months to try to sleep train?",

Apparently cat napping is normal until around 5-6minths but we have persisted with trying to resettle for some naps and it is occasionally successful. He is getting less resistant to resettling now and will sometimes connect his cycles if we use white noise. It was a huge pain tho as he would sometimes need 5 naps in the day and always cranky at bedtime \ud83d\ude06",

This is because babies have a balance in the back of their head if you just go straight down, they can loose that balance and makes them feel off.\n\nThere is a free sleep seminar starting on July 11th that teaches you how baby sleep works, when is baby ready to reduce night feeds and when is baby developmentally\nready to sleep through the night.\nIf you would like the link to join i can get that for you!

		"text": "Hi All, FTM. I joined this group because I needed sleeping tips for my 4 month old. When he was a newborn, he suffered with colic so I spent many nights with him screaming in pain. I was exhausted and I would end up crying my eyes out thinking I was doing something wrong. I just kept hearing it will get better or you think this is bad now, sometimes it goes on for months. I had so many plans before he was born of what i wouldn't do, I wanted to sleep train, he would never sleep in my bed, he will be independent and sleep on his own. All that went out the window bc he never liked being swaddled and didn't sleep long on his back. Due to his colic and gas, I walked him constantly to soothe him, and he ended up sleeping in bed with me. I even bought the cosleeper cot for him to sleep in my bed. At this stage, my little one takes naps during the day...I can't give you a schedule. At night he wakes up and feeds at any point, it feels like every 2 mins. I would like for him to sleep through the night. But my point is, and in reading all the posts and positive comments...Moms you are doing your best and don't think you are failing. Do not compare yourself to those that have best sleeping babies. Every baby is different, and we need to acknowledge that it's okay. Love and cuddle your crying babies, lack of sleep won't be forever. Once your baby is healthy and happy and you are doing your best, be proud that that baby can hold onto you and give you the sweetest hugs. Praying for us all to have a full night's sleep.",

That is repeated throughout the day. For bed time, we read a story, bath, lotion, sleeper, sleep sac, sound machine, and small lamp, and a bottle. After she eats and burps, I rock for 10 min and lay her in crib.\n\nThe picture is our current schedule. I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend picking up the moms on call book.

Also you can try a sleepy sack she might like it.",

		"text": "I was hesitate to post as i was afraid of being kind of told off after reading some of the comments but I am looking for encouragement and some support and advise ...\nFirst time mum to a rainbow baby boy after multiple losses hence maybe that's why I am too soft and have this attachment to my son after all trauma I endured .\n\nMy son sleeps with me in bed since he was born. Is there any of you who is the same I can not be the only one ?\n\nSo before I get to sleep training I need to work on getting him to sleep in his own cot. His cot is attached to my bed ! He is now over 3 months old. Everytime I would put him down he will cry to be picked up. He hates to be on his back. If he is already asleep in my arms after I transfer him he wakes up after few min and cry . The longest I get to have him asleep in the cot was maybe 30 min. Moro reflex wakes him up or when he spit the dummy or as soon as he realised where he is .At night neither of us was getting sleep so after a week of trying I gave up as I dont really mind having him in my bed but I know for a near future I would want him to sleep in his own cot on his own and it will be much harder because of the habit of sleeping with me .\nWhile he is sleeping with me he is so easy ... never cries wakes for food eat (i breastfeed on demand ) I Burp him then I change his nappy and he is going straight back to sleep.\nBut my goal is to have him sleeping on his own in the cot and in near future in his own crib.\nI will have a lot work to do so I am open for any advice . Thank you",

I'm on my second and I slept with both every night until they were about 3-4 months old.\n\nI had a difficult time transitioning them to their cot as well. What I ended up doing was putting a blanket in their car seat so it would be comfy and then I let them sleep in there. There is not as much room for them to wiggle and they're sleeping on a slant.\n\nAfter they were comfortable there I transitioned them to the top of the pack in play. I put a blanket down so it was comfy and put a wedge down so they could still sleep at a slant. The wedge is often used for babies with acid reflux so I knew it was safe to use it. My first born I transitioned to his crib at 6 months and he was fine but my boys would have to share a room now and I don't want to take a chance of either of them waking up each other up so my 6 month old still sleeps in his pack and play, he also still wakes up for feedings so it's easier to have him close.",

On his next feed he would then sleep with me until the morning and gradually I would have him in his own cot it\u2019s taken some time he\u2019s now almost 4 months and he hates going to bed on his own so I will nurse him and then put him in his cot and he will sleep through until his next feed I also tried the sssh sssh and lay him on his side and pat his bum he was screaming but soon settled (he gets very angry lol) I have found after having 6 children that to let them cry and self sooth (not for too long pick up if you feel they are crying too long leave the room first go out the kettle on then come back) my youngest gets super cross but after a good cry he soon calms himself down or I will pick him up and rock him to sleep as calmly as I can be then put him straight back in his cot with my hand on his bum and cheek eventually you will be able to move away taking a step back each day. It does get easier. My 5th baby (now 4) would only settle being rocked even now he won\u2019t sleep unless he\u2019s next to me ( he has autism asd) good luck mummy enjoy your baby don\u2019t be too hard on yourself they are only small for such a short time don\u2019t think your being too soft either I also have a rainbow baby.

Sleep training is for infants at start LEASt 4.5 months-6 month or older\u2014 most babies just don\u2019t have the capacity to self soothe before 6 months . \u201c9 months In- 9 months On\u201d 14 yrs ago I co-slept with my baby until he was at least 6 months old. We started off with naps in his crib and eventually started sleep training 9 months. I\u2019ve got a new 8 month old who still wakes up every 2-4 hrs; at around 4-5am we bring him into the bed til we\u2019re ready to be up. He just sleeps better cuddled, and that\u2019s ok for now. Trust your mumma instincts, you\u2019re baby will tell you when ready, and you\u2019ll know when to \u201cput your foot down\u201d and hold your ground. Best thing you can start doing now is get a regular routine; if you have a willing partner include them in the nighttime routine, that way they too can help out crying baby down (all too often, mom becomes the routine and dads/partners can\u2019t console baby). If you do have a bassinet/cot is put baby down drowsy, not quite yet asleep; stay and assure ( if needed) baby you\u2019re there, but let him learn to \u2018fall asleep\u2019 that last 5% on his own. You\u2019re doing great\u2014 don\u2019t stress too much about wake windows, strict regiments, etc. keep your routine and know it\u2019s ok to flex if needed, things will fall back into place. \ud83e\udd70",

				"text": "Sleep consultant here! Congrats on your rainbow \ud83c\udf08 baby!!! He\u2019s adorable.\n\nUnfortunately for some babies sleep training and crib sleeping can\u2019t be separated. Meaning.. in order to make that transition to his crib there will be protest. It\u2019s a change that he\u2019s not used to. His brain makes strong associations by this age so there will be some drama as you are changing that. But that\u2019s not a bad thing!!! And that doesn\u2019t mean your attachment will be shaken. In fact, In order for your baby to build a secure attachment he will need to be away from you, bc the wrestling with those emotions of mom not there then the reunification builds that secure attachment. It takes just a few nights at this young age. But for fairness for him you have to remove everything that his brain has formed an association with. Otherwise you won\u2019t see the crying decrease. So pacifier, swaddle, nursing to sleep, nursing til drowsy, rocking, co sleeping etc. If he\u2019s still reliant on something like getting drowsy while feeding then when he wakes his his brain goes right back to that association. If you don\u2019t give it there will be a lot of crying night after night, without the progress. If you do give it then it will reinforce the sleep association and cause more wakings. I hope I\u2019m making sense!!! So here\u2019s your goal\u2026 follow eat, play, sleep during the day with 1.5-1.75 hr wake windows. Bedtime move feed to the beginning of the routine\u2026 feed first keeping wide awake. Then bath, pjs, book and lay him in the crib wide awake. Then use a sleep training method to handle the crying consistently until he is asleep. I would also move the crib much farther from your bed. I know that\u2019s scary but babies tend to wake more often the closer they are to mom, instead of emerging from a sleep cycle going right into a new one.",

My opinion is you can do that while sleep training him no need to do one before the other! When it was time to sleep train my son I found this amazing program who helped me deal with the sleep issues he was having and sleeping on his own in 4 nights and using a very gentle sleep training because I wasn't comfortable with the CIO method. They are actually hosting a free sleep seminar at the end of June if you would like I could give you some more information!",

She is a great sleeper at night but hates napping during the day\u2026 here\u2019s an outline of her schedule:\n7:30am - wake/feed\n8:30am-10:30/\n11am - nap #1\n12:30/1pm-4pm - nap #2\n5:30/\n6pm-7:30pm - nap #3\nBedtime routine (bath, change, bottle, rocking chair) begins around 8pm and she is asleep by 9pm. She usually wakes up to eat around 4am. \ud83e\udd70\nPlease know that every baby is so different and regardless of what schedule you follow, you are doing an amazing job mama!!",

I've been doing this from around 2 weeks old and she's now 3 and a half months and she's been a great sleeper since. She'll waken around 3am looking her dummy I pop it back in and that's her till about 7. I was feeding her around 3am until I left her and just kept popping dummy in and she just went straight back over so I clicked on it was just habbit she was wakening for and not hunger ( if she's hungry she'll let me know lol) I'm strict on bottles during the day though, she's fed at 8am,11am,2pm,5p\nm (or else on the half hour, depending how she feels lol) then her bed time one at 8 ( an extra Oz in this one). I'll waken her for feeds if she's napping during the day and I think she sleeps through at night as she gets enough to do her during the day to tie her over. I also keep her awake from 630pm and don't let her sleep lol",

I read that long stretches at night are possible only once they are at least this weight and so it was like that with our baby. I exclusively pump - breast milk for all feeding, no formula.",

So he generally wakes between 6-630a and I\u2019ll feed him then he hangs out in bed between us for a few so daddy can see him then him and I go on a 40min morning walk (40 min gets us 2 miles and in this vegas warmth that\u2019s about all I can do lol) after our walk I feed him his bottle and then he goes to sleep for about 2hrs some times 3hrs. Wakes up hangs out etc and back asleep about an hour later. That\u2019s our daily routine. For night time he\u2019s usually down between 6-8p depending on his naps) that consists of a bath (every 2 days) and If not a bath day then lotion and snuggles then swaddle, bottle, burp and then put him in his bed. He\u2019s good at falling asleep on his own if he\u2019s not asleep by the time I put him down. He sleeps for 4-5hrs then up just to eat (never even opens his eyes or anything) then directly back to sleep for 3-4hrs same thing then about 2hrs later he wakes for the day. There have been times he\u2019s gone down for a nap at 5p and stayed asleep until midnight then eats goes back to sleep then up two times before the morning wake. But we\u2019ve tried very diligently to try to give him a last nap at 4 to avoid this then down at 6 on those days. Just depends on him lol",

He will sleep in his car seat, swing, and of course peoples arms but as soon as we lay him down we maybe get 20 minutes before he is screaming. Typically he has spit up next to him in the crib and needs to be burped. You can tell laying flat is causing his discomfort. I have tried to incline the mattress but he was rolling to his stomach which caused me to much stress and concern and did not seem to be helping. He is bottle fed breast milk with Dr Browns colic/ reflux bottles and burped at least every 2 oz of not more often. We have tried to keep him upright after eating for long periods of time and that doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference. He is also on Gerber Good Start probiotic drops as well.\n\nAny help or tips are greatly appreciated our sweet boy is exhausted and so are we, looking for some comfortable sleep for the entire family!",

We give it to him 30 minutes before the 1st and last bottle of the day, it's important not to just give it and feed straight away. I also did a specific baby massage nightly after his bath to help with colic/wind and use Dr Brown narrow neck bottles. He has been seeing a paediatric osteo which has been amazing, such improvement. She also picked up that he had a tongue and lip tie which we had lasered 4 weeks ago. He is now 4.5 months old and is so much better. Those first 7 weeks were absolutely horrible. He will likely go off the medication at 6 months old after a review by the Dr.",

Just think of it as if it were to cause you reflux it\u2019s something your baby could get from breast milk and thinking of it that way has helped me so much. Mine usually gets breast milk occasionally formula but once we switched to hypoallergenic and I cut dairy it has been a game changer along with his acid reflux medication right before bathtime to give it enough time to kick in. I hope you and your little one get some relief. Reflux is common. Mommas are strong you\u2019ll make it through!",

It broke my heart so bad.\n\nI hate to say it but I had him sleep on a boppy pillow beside me in a bedside bassinet so he could be propped up. It was the only way he could breathe well enough to sleep. It was terrifying but he was okay. He\u2019s 6 months now, a belly sleeper, free from dairy & soy, & still on his acid meds to help. He never has trouble anymore.\n\nOne thing my doctor said too is you can take receiving blankets and roll them up hot dog style and kinda wrap them into a U underneath the bed sheet. Then you can prop him up on the top of the U on and inclined mattress and that can help but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s gonna get stuffed right into his face.",

Then after this non stop crying until I give in and give her a bottle. Even then sometimes won\u2019t go down till 11:30.\nShould I try stretch her awake times to 1.5 hours or will she just be over tired?

If I'm losing sleep I might as well knock out two birds with one stone \ud83d\ude02\n\nWake Windows: typically around 1.5-2 hours and right before bed is 2 hours almost on the dot\n\nBackground: Takes medicine daily for acid reflux and sleeps in the crib full time except for one contact nap a day (I love the baby cuddles \ud83e\udd70) He also gets no screen time.\n\nFeedings: Formula fed with baby oatmeal in his milk for his acid reflux since the beginning 3 months old.\n\nSleep Routine: Sleeps with black out curtains, humidifer with lavender, sleep machine, does bedtime routine (bath, lotion, book, sleep sack, feeding, and a little play if he's not tired yet) Sleep/Nap times are usually 1-1.5 hours during the day each nap and one good 2 hour nap. Sometimes it can be 45 mins.\n\nTonight we started sleep training and I'm a little lost on if I'm doing everything right. I waited for his sleeping cues before I put him down. When he went down to sleep roughly around 8:45-9pm, he slept for 2-2.5 hours before he woke up and ever since then is waking up every hour. His first time going to bed, I said good night, put the paci in, and left. He did not cry and fell asleep on his own. After that, he's trying to self soothe but gets very frustrated because the paci will fall out of his mouth but once that's in when I check on him after a little crying he'll go back to sleep but will wake up an hour again later. Also, please don't comment and say to not start until 6 months and that it's not appropriate, because either way I'm starting now \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nQuestions:\n\n1: Do I let him cry for 15 mins or so before I just put the paci back in his mouth? Because that's really all he needs and will go back to sleep during the night- I've been waiting 15-20 mins but I'm not sure if I should put it in before that time for him to self soothe.\n\n2: Is sleep training at night different/easier than daytime naps?\n\n3: If the paci falls back out right after I leave do I go and put it right back in or do I let him cry more?\n\n4: How long does it take before he stop waking up every hour to be put back to sleep?\n\n5: is there anything that I'm missing? Any advice helps!\n\nPicture so the post doesn't get lost \ud83e\udd0d",

				"text": "This use to happen to my little one when I started sleep training her. I started at 3.5 months and got told to let my baby cry it out and eventually she would go to sleep. I didn't like the idea of this but I gave it a go. It lasted not even 1 day before I went back to assisting to sleep when cried. I also struggled with having to go in and out to keep putting the dummy in n out as she kept spitting it in and out. I then got told to take the dummy away which I didn't want to but got told it would be hard for the first 3 days but after that she will learn. I gave this a go also but she became worse, I started to then listen to myself n my gut and did what I thought was rite. So I gave the dummy back as it was not only breaking my heart but giving me major anxiety. I would go in and out and put it in and walk away untill she learnt to put it back in her mouth herself. I did sleep school and got her into a routine and eventually it became better n she was able to self sooth with or without the dummy. Once she was asleep she would spit the dummy out anyway. You can let him cry for a few minutes to see if he goes to sleep. If it's a winge I wouldn't go in but if it's a cry and a hysterical cry then I would go in..I learnt my daughter's cries so when she needed me I new to go in but if it was a sook and winge i wouldn't go in and eventually she would go back down. Goodluck your doing a great job \ud83d\udc95",

				"text": "So I just sleep trained my four month old as he was waking up every 30 mins to an hour wanting his paci all night long! I couldn\u2019t handle it any longer!\nThe first few nights were really rough! I would do night routine feed him his bottle and put him down and give him his binkie. The first few nights, he cried and cried! It was horrible but now he sleeps through the whole night and puts himself back to sleep. For about the first week to two he would wake up for so long in the middle of the night trying sooth that he ended up hungry and I would feed him but after two weeks he didn\u2019t need that anymore.\nI personally did the extinction Ferber method as my son just got more upset when I would come in!\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, you want to go in for at most 1 minute, pat/rub them, and say you\u2019re there then leave. I didn\u2019t give my son his binkie as that was the biggest habit we were trying to break with sleep training. He needed to learn another way to get soothed, as the goal was for him to sleep on his own without my assistances.\nMomma you do what works best for you! Your gut will tell you what feels right and doesn\u2019t! \ud83d\ude0a",

The first few nights I did it like 5 minutes then added 5 so it went to ten then added another 5 so next it was 15 and so on! But after realizing he only cried harder after I did that, my husband and I decided to not go in anymore and let him work through it himself. He quit crying going to sleep after 4 nights I think it was. He woke up in the middle of the night try to go back to sleep for such a long period of time that I believe he was hungry so I fed him and put him back in his crib and he\u2019d go to sleep. I also read to reduce his ounces amount each time in his bottle so that you slowly take it away so I did that too! I think he took the bottle in the middle of the night for a week to two weeks! I can\u2019t remember exactly! It\u2019s all kind a blur \ud83d\ude02\nI only initially gave him his paci the first time I put him down and then I would sent two next to him where he could grab them.",

I've heard though that its best to let them have it while falling asleep but remove it before they go into the crib or have lots setup around so they can replace it themselves (although for a baby as young as yours the later option likely isn't possible).",

What is most important right now is putting her in her crib (I have a cot nearby where I\u2019m with her) since for the the past two months she literally has slept on me. She hates the swaddle- she will be ok during CRIES, but within 15 minutes she is angry after putting her down. So, I got the Merlin sleeper. Question: do I rock her and feed her in it and then put her down? When I go to pick her up to comfort and put her back to sleep, she\u2019s always in it, right?? I know it\u2019s a silly question, but it\u2019s so bulky \ud83d\ude02.\nI start grad school again and working, and she is starting to roll to her side, that I really am just wanting to make sure she is in a safe place. For those that had co-sleepers on them, did it take long for them to adjust? I\u2019m nervous! My first was a dream and slept through the night with little help at 2 months and was a natural at falling asleep on his own. My little girl is a fighter to stay on mom. During the day, fine- but night I want her to be safe. Thanks in advance!",

		"text": "Hello, I need help or suggestions or anything that may help our situation. We are at a loss on what to do. We have 2 daughters 11 months and 3.5 years. 11 month old sleeps in our room in her own crib. 3.5 year old has her own room. We have a crib in girls room as they share a room but we cannot move 11 month old in until the toddler sleeps through the night.\n\nSo the 3.5 year old used to sleep wonderfully and through the night no problems. But something changed the last few months to where she wakes anywhere from 2-4 times a night. She will walk across the house to our room where we immediately take her back to her room and to bed every time. She did this when she took an afternoon nap so we stopped naps to see if she needed to be more tired but nope still waking without naps too. I feel like now it has become a habit wake up and I don\u2019t know how to break it when she just gets up and comes to our room. We did have a baby gate keeping her in her room but she has figured out how to unlock it and really when the gate was there she would just scream and cry waking the house up until someone would come. Sometimes she says she is scared, sometimes she wants water, other times she wants nothing. She sleeps with a glow warm to help when she wants a little light, we sprays air freshener that we pretend is bad guy spray every night, we keep water in her room for when she is thirsty to try and get her to stay in her room and sleep but nothing is working. We don\u2019t know what to do. If you have any suggestions anything is welcome!!!",

That really struck me about how and why babies wake suddenly and upset sometimes if they get transferred to a different place after falling asleep. Mine seems to do ok with it, she would fall asleep in my arms and then I would put her in her basinet next to the bed and she would wake but was never upset by it. I've started having her sleep all night between me and my husband bc she can stand up in thw badinet and I'm worried sge will fall out of it or knock it over. I'm figuring she will sleep with us a little longer before we transition her to her crib.",

If it doesn't work and makes you or your baby worse off then it might be bad and you might need to work to change it. I always advise to do what works for you and once it stops working then work to change it. It is never too late to work on independent sleep, there are no deadlines. Looking after a little one is hard as it is so you need to do what works for you and what is bad for one might not be bad for another, it just depends on individual situation. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f",

Then go in after 5 mins IF she\u2019s still crying, lie her back down and give her her comforter back, then leave again and wait 10 mins then 15.. the main thing is to keep the vibe positive and calm when you go in. And only go in at those time intervals if she\u2019s crying. Avoid direct eye contact and only say things like \u2018shh bedtime now\u2019. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done anyway.\nThe first night she cried for 25 minutes so I intervened twice.\nThe second night, 8 mins.\nThe 3rd night , 3 minutes\nAnd the 4th and 5th night only an initial cry when I put her down but by the time I\u2019ve left the room and sat back down, she\u2019s soundo.

Don\u2019t make someone feel like a bad parent because you view something different than they do.

				"text": "Honestly, I know a lot of parents are against it (and some believe in it - to each their own!) but I let my son cry ir out because he usually self soothes himself after 10/15 minutes. (I\u2019m right outside the door and if he\u2019s screaming bloody murder I go in asap). I have to do this because at our home we have blackout blinds and I have black towels tacked up on each side for optimal darkness but when he\u2019s at my parents (every Saturday) my mom has 8ft high windows in her bedroom (where he sleeps at night/ naps during the day) and it\u2019s bright as heck. I couldn\u2019t even nap in there on a sunny day, and the sun goes down between 8/9pm. So when he\u2019s there he cries ir out to self soothe.\nAgain I know this method isn\u2019t for everyone and we don\u2019t let him go too long if he\u2019s really crying but it has helped him with naps at my parents and he\u2019s learned to self soothe because of it. He\u2019s a year old and off formula (couldn\u2019t breastfeed) and on whole milk so I usually give him a 4 oz bottle before his morning nap and 4oz before his afternoon nap and that helps too! He also gets an 8oz bottle before bedtime and one when he wakes up in the morning.\nAgain - not for everyone! Try different things and you\u2019ll learn what works best for you and your babe. Honestly it\u2019s mostly a trial and error game. But you\u2019ll find out what works best for you!",

I started in increments at 2 months of just 10 minutes after a diaper change and bottle I bumped it up to 15 at 3 months she was 4.5 months all I had to do was diaper bottle and lay down she slept through the night and put herself to sleep. She\u2019s now 7 months and has no issues at all sleeps through the night and every thing make sure you talk to your pediatrician first too because mine was growing and gaining perfectly that she didn\u2019t need to wake up for night feedings",

Of course it also depends on the age. When they are still very little they can't handle such big bottles, but as they get bigger then it's possible. We dropped one of two night feeds probably around 4-5 months of age and still do a dreamfeed at around midnight before going to bed now at almost 8 months of age.",
