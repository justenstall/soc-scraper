I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it.

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller.

Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

Naps, so him being alone in his bassinet is a big change in itself, I‚Äôm wondering do i just make the switch to the crib now‚Ä¶will i have to sleep train twice if the environment is slightly different. I will still have his noise machine etc. He‚Äôs a sensitive baby and he‚Äôs refusing naps and waking frequently at night now, so seems like nows the time to sleep train.","06/21/2022, 23:59:51"

Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets ü§£.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 00:59:51"

I keep reading about how many once‚Äôs you feed your babies and I have a question about that. I have a 5.5 month old and I give her 5 ounces. I‚Äôm not sure if maybe this is why she keeps waking up after midnight. Just asking to see how much you feed your babies and if it helps them sleep longer

But I found that breastmilk is thinner and she eats/wakes more frequently. But with anywhere between 4-6oz of formula it fills her up longer before bed and she usually sleeps 6.5 hours before her next feeding in the really early morning (3-4am) . Then another 4oz usually holds her over between 7-9am. Hope that helps! The little cutie may just need more before bed!,"06/21/2022, 22:00:17"

I mainly feed bubba on the boob and i feed until she pulls off. Sometimes she could be on a boob up to 45 mins and the other boob between 15 to 20 mins and pulls herself off. Only from time to time i give her a top up if needed from formula. But everyones LO is all different as to how much they need as long as they are gaining weight. At the end of the day just do what is right for you and bubba. She beautiful too by the way üòÅ,"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"
