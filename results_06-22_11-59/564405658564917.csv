I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it.

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller.

Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

Naps, so him being alone in his bassinet is a big change in itself, I‚Äôm wondering do i just make the switch to the crib now‚Ä¶will i have to sleep train twice if the environment is slightly different. I will still have his noise machine etc. He‚Äôs a sensitive baby and he‚Äôs refusing naps and waking frequently at night now, so seems like nows the time to sleep train.","06/21/2022, 23:59:51"

Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets ü§£.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 00:59:51"

She sleeps from 6pm-12am, feed and change, then from 12:45am-7am. Which doc said was fine but not to go over 6 hours at her 4 week appointment. The other day she had a bit longer day than usual and I haven‚Äôt been setting an alarm to feed because she‚Äôs great at letting me know. Well she slept through the night and because I was exhausted so did I. I‚Äôm talking 8 1/2 hours! I woke up panicked but she was just fine and woke up about 15 minutes later and drank a whole 6 ounces. I thought it was a fluke but she keeps trying to do it again. I set an alarm at 6 hours so she can eat but she has very little interest in it. This hasn‚Äôt changed her behavior or eating patterns throughout the day except she eats more during her first morning feed. I guess what I want to know is, is it ok for her to sleep that long at her age?

Her weight never dropped below birth weight and she has been steadily adding on the pounds. At her 4 week appointment she was 8 lbs 15 ounces and today she is 11 lbs 2 ounces.

If you feel more comfortable waking her every 6 hours then do that, but if she‚Äôs fine then don‚Äôt stress! Also she will likely want more milk if she‚Äôs sleeping more so that makes sense. You can check if she‚Äôs dehydrated (the frontal will be dipped if she is, so offer milk in those times as well). But other than that I would say all is okay.

They say online a good judgement is 2.5oz for every pound is what baby should be eating. I went by that and we never had a issue.

When I went home they didn‚Äôt tell me I didn‚Äôt have to do that anymore so I was waking her every 3 hours to feed. Best advice I got around 3-4 weeks was NEVER wake a sleeping baby haha provided they are healthy and putting on weight at a good pace, if they want to sleep, let them sleep. Sleep promotes more sleep.
