I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"

We finally laid him down in his bed by himself one night and put himself to sleep. Your babies are only young enough to hold and cuddle for so long, so take advantage of it.

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller.

Then repeat until she is asleep. She‚Äôs probably over tired now as you said so I would give her some snuggles and try the pick up put down method or do a nap in your arms and try again for the next nap after she is well rested.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I‚Äôm reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he‚Äôs upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he‚Äôs been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he‚Äôs never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I‚Äôll be honest but now He‚Äôs learnt that no matter what mama will come. I‚Äôve watched him in the mornings and he‚Äôll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

Naps, so him being alone in his bassinet is a big change in itself, I‚Äôm wondering do i just make the switch to the crib now‚Ä¶will i have to sleep train twice if the environment is slightly different. I will still have his noise machine etc. He‚Äôs a sensitive baby and he‚Äôs refusing naps and waking frequently at night now, so seems like nows the time to sleep train.","06/21/2022, 23:59:51"

Just for reference in my situation my current 9 year old slept with us till he was 5 (still comes to cuddle often) my now 4.5 year old slept with us till 1 year ago (still comes in to cuddle sometimes) my 7 month old sleeps on his own but between 3 and 5 am wakes to nurse, cuddle, get his diaper changed, then snuggle back to sleep then takes up most of the bed till one of the older kids comes in then I put the baby in his bassinet and wake up between 7 and 8... I get better sleep this way than if I fight them. Sometimes when our infant is asleep and my husband is snoring like a freaking hippo, I sneek away and snuggle one of the other kiddos, bc I can't sleep next to his air sucking face with how loud he gets ü§£.
You got this, and no matter what try to be patient. Praying in my moments of stress and anger and hurt help me a lot. I have been in the moments of its 3 am and I haven't slept well in days or I don't feel good or hubby is out of town and all the kids need me constantly. I loss it and yell or worse; scream. But I calm (hopefully before yelling and or screaming) pray and just know someday I won't get sleep bc they will be out doing God knows what with who knows who, and they won't even care about snuggles with mommy. It's already starting with my 9 year old, he would rather be with his friends than us right now. Thank you for reminding me, I am not the only mother who has felt overwhelmed at times.
Something I do for my little during the day is leave a shirt for the babysitter to lay in his bassinet with him or for him to hold and chew on or smell when I am away. He naps decent for her and we attribute it to mommy's shirt. Maybe try this and it may help to keep him in his crib for a bit. Sorry for the lengthy response!","06/22/2022, 00:59:51"

She sleeps from 6pm-12am, feed and change, then from 12:45am-7am. Which doc said was fine but not to go over 6 hours at her 4 week appointment. The other day she had a bit longer day than usual and I haven‚Äôt been setting an alarm to feed because she‚Äôs great at letting me know. Well she slept through the night and because I was exhausted so did I. I‚Äôm talking 8 1/2 hours! I woke up panicked but she was just fine and woke up about 15 minutes later and drank a whole 6 ounces. I thought it was a fluke but she keeps trying to do it again. I set an alarm at 6 hours so she can eat but she has very little interest in it. This hasn‚Äôt changed her behavior or eating patterns throughout the day except she eats more during her first morning feed. I guess what I want to know is, is it ok for her to sleep that long at her age?

Her weight never dropped below birth weight and she has been steadily adding on the pounds. At her 4 week appointment she was 8 lbs 15 ounces and today she is 11 lbs 2 ounces.

If you feel more comfortable waking her every 6 hours then do that, but if she‚Äôs fine then don‚Äôt stress! Also she will likely want more milk if she‚Äôs sleeping more so that makes sense. You can check if she‚Äôs dehydrated (the frontal will be dipped if she is, so offer milk in those times as well). But other than that I would say all is okay.

Sometimes I can get dad to give her a bottle then rock her to bed, but it‚Äôs rare. I usually just give up and breastfeed her until she falls asleep. She does not take a paci and I tried a soother and she takes it at times, but then remembers that‚Äôs not a nipple and starts rejecting it. Every time she wakes up I try to pad her and sooth her in the bassinet, but it doesn‚Äôt help as she starts crying for me to pick her up and breastfeed her again to sleep. Also, she does not like swaddles. I have tried sleep sacks as Love Me and Zen zack and she doesn‚Äôt like them. She usually sleeps 4-5 hours then wakes up I BF again then sleeps for 2 more hours. What can I do start teaching her to sleep without BF, swaddled and paci? I feel like sometimes she is overeating and gets gassy. I have even coslept because I literally have even fallen asleep.

We also figured out that every time the AC would kick on, she would freak out and wake up because the vent was blowing directly at her pack and play, so we started putting extra layers on her, and she sleeps so much better, she must not like the cold. We thought she hated swaddles too, turns out they weren‚Äôt tight enough, she loves to be swaddled the way they do in the hospital, with just some receiving blankets, we double them and swaddle her twice. The only other swaddle she will sleep with is the love to dream arms up one. And we keep her hatch on the red light with washing machine sounds, anything else is too stimulating for her. We look for sleep cues and put her to bed awake, if we wait to long and she falls asleep on us, she wakes up when moving her screaming, and if we put her down too soon, she‚Äôs screaming. We wait until her eyes become heavy, and she starts yawning with the red eyebrows. She is also our hiccup and gassy girl, so gripe water has been a godsend and she usually gets between .5-1 ml after every feed.

Our baby sleeps in similar chunks at night and I breastfeed her when she wakes then she falls asleep on the boob again once she‚Äôs full.

If she is gassy you can do the ‚Äúbicycle legs‚Äù 5-10 minutes every diaper change and right before bed, gripe water, and making sure she gets a good burp out after each feeding! I had my baby in bed with me for a while after we came home from the hospital and it worked well for us, if you are comfortable with that! There are ways you can safely share a bed with a baby. Just make sure there are no pillows or blankets super close to the baby, and make sure your house temp is set at a good temperature (68-70 degrees)..altho
ugh I do heat that cooler temperatures are better for safe sleeping. Babies that young don‚Äôt move much while sleeping so you don‚Äôt have to worry about her rolling over on her tummy or into a blanket/pillow for a while.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

on being a great attentive mama üòâ) would be to suggest a schedule/
routine so that both of you are not worn out with feeds AND begin putting her down before she is rooting and showing signs of exhaustion. We sometimes think that patting(this is kinds fast here too) will help but it often overstimulates and then they get in a cycle of not being able to calm/sleep. Create a calm place for her to go down, do a schedule and tey to put her down before ages exhausted. I promise it will help every single time. Getting her sleep set for the day will set it at night. üíï

My daughter is 4months old and since she was 2 months she started doing the same as your daughter when she is tired, she rubs her head to self sooth. Everyone told me ‚Äúsleep train‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. When I tried to at 2 months she was really crying with the routine, so I stopped it. A month later she started to sleep by herself 4hours plus, and here we are about to be 2 months of her sleeping herself. My point is, they do their own routine in my opinion, nobody likes to get forced to sleep. Doctors even told me when she wants to sleep she will sleep. And I‚Äôm glad I listened. Don‚Äôt get me wrong some parents do need to sleep train but thankfully I just let her do her routine on her own.

We have tried everything and my baby is 5 months. She rejected a pacifier up until she was 4 months old and now finally takes the itzy ritzy ones. I would just say try to have a pretty strict routine and she will most likely learn that it‚Äôs time for bed and get used to whatever you do. You may want to try maybe feeding her a bottle before bed and have that only for bed so she knows that is it and then sleep.

At night I would only feed on demand and eventually the stretches that she slept got longer as her caloric needs got met throughout the day.

At this age it's not recommended to do any kind of sleep training and to do everything on demand until 6 months. After that you can start giving he other ways to cope like butt tapping, rubbing back, playing with hair etc. Once your little is good with that move to a crib at naps because that is when you are the most awake and then at night once your little is good with the crib at naps. You'll also want to play in your littles room and rock them or do bedtime routine in their room until it's time to sleep so your baby is used to their room when it's time to start putting them in their crib.

I say, always stick to a routine at a specific time frame. Ours is between 7-9pm, depending on her feedings. Throughout the day, I make sure to feed her every 2-3 hours. Naps are no longer than 2 hours. And by the time it‚Äôs bedtime, we start our routine: 1. Bath 2. Onesie 3. FULL FEED (we feed her max right now 5 oz of formula) 4. Spouse reads a book while I feed 5. Burp then let her digest a bit sitting slightly up in my arms. 6. Put her swaddle on 7. Bring her to her crib and sing her a lullaby (we have a hatch and put it on red light 10% and washer sound 30%) 8. Kiss goodnight 9. Place her in crib and leave the room.

We watch her on our camera until she falls asleep. Usually takes about 5-10 minutes. She sometimes gets a little fussy around 4am so I rock her a bit and give her her pacifier then put her back to bed.","06/22/2022, 02:01:49"

564298178575665,https://facebook.com/564298178575665,"Many safe sleep experts have expressed concern about the potential for a baby to overheat while sleeping in the Magic Sleepsuit. Even Merlin suggests ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù the baby in the sleepsuit, emphasizing on their website that it's the responsibility of the parent or caregiver to ensure that the baby does not overheat. I think it is not very safe","06/21/2022, 15:02:17"

Mostly either wore it with a short sleeve onesie or just his diaper. Our current 4 month old girl hates it. I randomly tried everything and in the end she loved a weighted sleep sack... even then, she‚Äôs not totally on board with it completely.","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

We‚Äôre still working on that wake up time. The first night our LO woke up around 11pm screaming but was rocked back to sleep quickly. We haven‚Äôt heard a peep from her at night since then.
