I follow a sleep schedule making sure his naps are not too long but he has the right amount of awake windows. I make sure he eats enough through the day and also that when he is awake I interact with him. But he won't settle for his night sleep until 11pm and wakes every time we place him down in his basket until 11pm. Then he wakes up at 2am and again at 4am. He also wakes full at 7am. I'm so tired and don't know what more I can do. I have my tops that smell like me with him when he sleeps ans he is swaddled he won't sleep without the swaddle at night. I am at a loss. Picture of my little one is here,"06/22/2022, 03:57:47"

My 6 month old still wakes twice a night. Our pediatrician said she’s doing great weight wise, so we don’t need to feed her anymore during the night, but we still find she sometimes likes to comfort feed and be held for a bit before putting her back in her bassinet. Other times, we can pop the pacifier back in her mouth without needing to pick her up and she falls right back asleep. Each baby is so different- it seems some people have babies that sleep through the night fairly quickly and for others it takes a bit. I understand the frustration & exhaustion. It will get better though- just hang in there!","06/23/2022, 08:53:12"

No sleep training or anything like that. She was just ready at that point and didn't need any feeds in the night. All babies are different. I know people with toddlers who don't sleep through. Don't worry and try and sleep in the day to catch up on sleep or ask someone to look after baby while you go for a sleep or get partner to get up with baby and you have a lay in 🙂 it does pass.

I used to follow a schedule and when it wasn't working I did away with it and started watching for her cues and things were a bit better. If you breast feed also your baby is probably just digesting quickly. If it's possible to feed him more before bed I would try that too.

Try to get him to bed earlier (around 8pm) by introducing a regular unwinding bed time routine. We do bottle, stories and cuddles for 30mins before bed and it really helped my 4mth old settle into his first block of sleep which now goes for anywhere from 5 - 7 hours","06/22/2022, 00:00:00"

At 3 months even up to 6-8 months it's very normal for bubs to wake 2-3 times overnight. Around 4 months the sleep cycle matures and with habits like nightly bath or lowlights and waking baby at 7 each day can help start bed time earlier. But baby may still wake for feeds. Some babies sleep big stretches earlier, but maybe only 20% in my experience.

The two things that have made the biggest difference for our 11 week old (sleep at 9/9.30, wakes at 3 and 6 then up at 7.30) was a bath at night (feed before and then the bath tires him out and makes him hungry so he eats more) and making the room pitch black.","06/22/2022, 00:00:00"

564822738523209,https://facebook.com/564822738523209,564629861875830,"I cluster feed my 11 week old before bed. I’m breastfeeding, but sometimes I swear he will be eating for almost 2 hours but then he’s down for the count for 5-6 hours. I wake generally a little before he does and we do a dream feed. I find if you get to them before they’re fully awake when they start moving their mouth around they go right back down easier. Next stretch is 2-3 hours then 2-3 again cuz he more or less snacks at those feeds it seems. Your boy looks bigger like mine, and he may just be hungry, I would make sure he’s good and full (milk drunk) and this may help him stretch out that first leg of sleep.","06/22/2022, 10:53:13"
