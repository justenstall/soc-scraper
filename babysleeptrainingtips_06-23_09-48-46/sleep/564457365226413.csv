The first few nights were hard bc I had to walk to his room to settle, feed and change him, but now he might wake up twice during the night. I think him waking up and seeing our bed and knowing we were right there made him wake up more when he would slightly wake and move around. Good luck!","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
564561051882711,https://facebook.com/564561051882711,564457365226413,"I’ve used Taking Cara Babies! Life changing. Went from only 2-3 hour increments of sleep per night to now 9 hours! My LO is 10 weeks and she has been getting consistent sleep since a week after we started TCB’s newborn course (around 5 weeks old).

I say, always stick to a routine at a specific time frame. Ours is between 7-9pm, depending on her feedings. Throughout the day, I make sure to feed her every 2-3 hours. Naps are no longer than 2 hours. And by the time it’s bedtime, we start our routine: 1. Bath 2. Onesie 3. FULL FEED (we feed her max right now 5 oz of formula) 4. Spouse reads a book while I feed 5. Burp then let her digest a bit sitting slightly up in my arms. 6. Put her swaddle on 7. Bring her to her crib and sing her a lullaby (we have a hatch and put it on red light 10% and washer sound 30%) 8. Kiss goodnight 9. Place her in crib and leave the room.

We watch her on our camera until she falls asleep. Usually takes about 5-10 minutes. She sometimes gets a little fussy around 4am so I rock her a bit and give her her pacifier then put her back to bed.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

There are days lately when my LO wants to nap for 3/3.5 hours and when I try to wake her at the 2 hour mark, I have so much trouble keeping her awake through play and interacting 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️","06/22/2022, 00:00:00"

564810041857812,https://facebook.com/564810041857812,564561051882711,"[NAME REDACTED] it’s rare where she wants to nap longer than 2 hours. But when it’s been 2 hours, it’s usually time for a feeding anyways. So sometimes I’ll touch her chest and start talking to her. If she’s still sleepy, I pick her up and off her a bottle to her lips. Usually by then she’ll wake to feed.

And sometimes she’ll still be sleepy too after that long nap/feeding! I think it’s totally normal. Especially if it’s hot outside and we’re out and about. I just keep that in mind for her next wake window. For example, if she just took a long nap and she still wants to nap after her feeding, I let her nap again. I know now that her wake window after this nap will be extended. Sometimes to 2-2.5 hours! At this age according to TCB, they want their wake windows from 60-90 minutes, but sometimes it’s tough keeping them awake when you know they’re exhausted. Just listen to your baby. Don’t try to force it if they don’t want to. TCB is a guideline for you. But it’s up to you to adjust to your baby’s needs and this is what works for me and my baby. Hope that helps! 😁","06/22/2022, 10:54:02"

But after taking the TCB course, I tried just soothing her and rocking her back to bed. And it worked! If she started crying and I couldn’t soothe her back to bed, then I would feed her. But our pediatrician said she’s at a healthy weight and if she wants to sleep longer, to let her sleep longer.","06/22/2022, 10:54:02"

564983315173818,https://facebook.com/564983315173818,564561051882711,"[NAME REDACTED] If you don’t want to buy it, you can just go on her Instagram and watch all of her highlighted stories. Those alone are super helpful. But basically there are 6 tips that can help:
1. Swaddle (both arms in)
2. Wake a sleeping baby during the day (ex: don’t exceed 2 hour naps)
3. Use blackout curtains for naps/bedtime (we got one from Amazon) and keep it DARK. Should be dark enough to where you can’t really see your hand waving in front of your face.
4. Use a sound machine. We use a hatch on red light mode with washing machine sound at 30%. Should be enough to block outside noise. Not too loud.
5. Try to lay baby down at least once a day in the crib or bassinet during naps. If it doesn’t work, holding in your arms is fine as well as carrying them in a carrier (baby wearing).
6. Pay attention to wake windows for the age of your LO
7. When baby starts getting fussy/crying during naps/bedtime, you go through these steps to see if you can soothe them back to sleep. It’s called the SITBACK method.
S- Stop and observe. Let them cry/fuss for a bit.
I- Introduce sound (sound machine)
T- Touch their chest.
B- Binky
A- Add rocking (rock them in their crib by touching their chest and moving your hand slightly side to side)
C- Cuddle, pick them up and rock/cuddle them
K- K, it’s time to feed

Basically, give each letter about 20-30 seconds before continuing to the next letter. If you go through all of it/not responding to your soothing techniques, they’re probably hungry.

Sometimes my LO will wake up and all she needs is her pacifier and slightly louder sound machine.

Sorry, it was kind of hard to give just a jist of the program 😂. Hope this helps!","06/22/2022, 15:54:02"

564750801863736,https://facebook.com/564750801863736,564509751887841,[NAME REDACTED] yes! It’s quite simple. The most important factor is having a bedtime routine. Bath bottle(or boob) book bed. I usually put baby sleep still at this point but he’s little enough I feel like for us it’s not a concern at this point. But the most important thing is when baby starts to fuss at night or make noise take a PAUSE before rushing to them. Sleep cycles between all mammals are interrupted between periods of awake between cycles so it’s normal for a baby to shuffle around or cry a little or in my case my boy grunts a lot. Just wait a few minutes and see if they fall back asleep naturally if not then there’s no reason in making them cry for 15 minutes or whatever the Ferber method is go help your baby.,"06/22/2022, 00:00:00"

We did initially just for a couple of minutes until they are drowsy but not asleep.They will fall asleep in their sleeping space. So that worked. One baby had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Routine mattered to them. If you start training them at an older age, start with 5 minute increments.

564495068555976,https://facebook.com/564495068555976,564463745225775,"[NAME REDACTED] So I always would rock my baby to sleep for all naps and bed. I slowly cut down little by little. She would then be drowsy but awake and once she got used to that I would rock her less and less until she was in the crib wide awake. If she cried, I would get her and rock her and try again the next nap or bed time! So basically, the amount of help I gave her slowly “faded” until I was putting her into her crib wide awake! It was really painless for me and shes been going down wide awake for almost 3 months now with no issues!","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

I just started putting him in his crib sleepy and he would fuss for about 2-3 minutes and I would rock him back. One day my husband just put him in sleepy and he started crying so I went to get him. My husband stopped me and said let him try. Sure enough he knocked out in like 3 minutes. Now all we do is put him down and he puts himself to sleep. Zero rocking.,"06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

We started working with a sleep Dr. And decided to do the extinction method since it’s the fastest to work. We were going to do the Ferber ish method but honestly the more nights that are involved/
prolonged sleep training methods the more crying in the long run. So instead, doing extinction she cried for 10 minutes two times the first night and the second night about 6 minutes when we put her down initially then slept through the night. She still fusses/cries for a couple (literally between 2-5 mins) minutes when we put her down but we are on day 5 and she sleeps all night.
It breaks any mom heart to hear your baby cry but as long as they are safe, full, changed and in a comfortable room that is just their way of communicating change… im telling you, I have PPA and it’s only set off when I hear her cry but after seeing her sleep so good and wake up so happy I know it’s what’s best for her.

My daughter was sleeping 2 hours max at a time at 6 weeks old.
By 10 weeks old she was waking up 1 time through the night with her finally going to sleep before 10 and 11.
She is almost 6 months old and she goes to sleep between 7:30 and 8pm and wakes at 7am.
She sometimes wakes up one time through the night. But sometimes she is out like a light.
Consistency is key. Get a routine down, and stick with it. A sound machine is life changing too.
Now I turn the fan and sound machine on, light off,lay my baby down and she is asleep within 5 minutes.
I never had to do the CIO method. And I don’t have to give her a bottle for her to sleep. Every baby is different though! I consider myself very lucky. This is just what worked for us! You’ve got this! It does get better, and you will sleep again I promise!","06/22/2022, 00:00:00"
