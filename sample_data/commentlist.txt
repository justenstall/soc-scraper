	 'comment_text': 'During the day, we just try to follow wake windows for naps and an eat, play, sleep schedule. We donâ€™t have specific times that my 3 month old eats or naps. I just try to keep her awake for 90-105 minutes in between naps but sometimes she gets fussy before her wake window is supposed to be finishing. When that happens, I try to change the environment but if that doesnâ€™t help, Iâ€™ll just put her down for a nap. I donâ€™t let her sleep more than 2 hours at a time in the day for naps and try not to exceed 5.5 hours total of daytime naps. She goes down for bed between 7-8pm and then I do a dream feed at 9:30-10:30pm. She usually sleeps 7-9 hours after the dream feed. Good luck mama. You got this!',

	 'comment_text': 'Mine didnâ€™t sleep longer stretches until I put him in the Merlin Sleep Suit at 3 months. I just transitioned him out of it last week during his sleep regression and now heâ€™s sleeping through the night wearing a regular sleep sack.\n\nWhat I learned for my baby is to make sure he gets enough milk during the day (30-35 oz breastmilk in 24 hours for my 4.5 month. Heâ€™s a monster), have a consistent bed time routine that starts around 6:30 with a bedtime around 7-7:30, black out curtains, white noise machine, and getting enough stimulation during the day like floor time or walks around the neighborhood.\n\nDefinitely donâ€™t give him water in a bottle. Itâ€™s dangerous to give babies water before 6 months. After 6 months, theyâ€™re only allowed to have a little bit.\n\nI can send you a pdf I found helpful! Just PM me!',

	 'comment_text': 'My guy is almost 4 months old. I follow this sleep schedule from huckleberry and itâ€™s 4 naps total. the first nap is 1 hour and 15 mins. The second and third are 1 hour and 30 mins and the last is a 30 min nap. The rest of his sleep is at night. His wake windows are about 1 hr and 30 mins to 1 hr and 45 mins give or take. I also use a magic Merlin suit on him and he sleep pretty good in it. At first It wasnâ€™t easy but I put my guy down when he was awake and drowsy so he learned to fall asleep on his own. Consistency is key. He wake up once in the night now. Bed time is 8 and he wake up around maybe 2-3 am to eat and falls back asleep to wake up at 6 or 7 in the morning. Hopefully this helps a little ðŸ™‚',

A schedule at this age is really not doable but following routines is exactly what you need to do. At this age they should only be awake 1.5 hours to a max 2 hours! I was missing some early cues before!!! And maybe you are too. They should also be napping a total about 4 hours (earlier naps tend to be longer and hey shorter as day goes)â€¦ so look at the clock and when it gets close 1.5 hours start looking for crankinessâ€¦ then do a quick nap routine (short book or song) and put baby to nap. Once I understood that cycle it got so much easier!!! Iâ€™m using Little Zâ€™s Sleep and i wish I did it sooner!',

We use the merlin sleep suit, a wubbanub, a red light, baby susher and his mobile plays music. . The suit can be worn up to 9 months or until little one rolls over, back to front and back to front. When he is fighting to sleep, my husband or I go it, put in his pacifier and rub his tummy. If he doesn't calm down after about a half hour I will rock him and try again. We will continue doing that, every 5 to 10 minutes, until he calms down and then he falls asleep. I try to avoid taking him out of the crib, but if he's upset I will hold him, until he has calmed down. Our little guy eats every 4 to 5 hours; 6 to 8 ounces. We go off of his cues and are adjusting his schedule accordingly, but bedtime is always the same. Good luck and your little guy is adorable!!!",
