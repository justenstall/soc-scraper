My little is 7 weeks old and I need some advice as a FTM.
He currently eats every 2 hours in the day time. He eats 2-3 ounces each time. At night if he’s asleep he’ll go 3-4 before waking up for a bottle. Is it something I’m doing wrong as to why he’s eating every 2 hours still or is that ok?

He also fights his sleep so much. He’ll nap during the day after bottles, but not very well and at night sometimes he’s up for hours not wanting to sleep or having trouble getting into a deep sleep.

We’re currently not on any set schedule, we just go by when he’s tired/hungry and let him tell us what he needs. Mainly because idk how to get a baby on a schedule? Lol if he’s not tired at a nap time or is tired when it isn’t what do I do? Lastly, how do I help him differentiate between a nap and bedtime?

Sorry if these questions seem silly I’m just at such a loss because again, I’m a first time mom and he was in the nicu until almost 4 weeks so it feels like I missed out on establishing things early. 😞 TIA","06/20/2022, 11:53:34"

If can’t breastfeed then in the morning when he wakes up open curtains and go outside into the light. Then naps with curtains open. At night keep lights low. It takes some time but he will get into the circadian rhythm. Then small feeds in the middle of the night and straight back to sleep. Keeps lights low while feeding at night.

All i can suggest is learning your baby's sleep cues and start putting them down for naps so you don't develope a habit of letting him get overtired. Literally putting them in their crib or bassinet to sleep is good too, for some of the times so they can get used to it. Biggest mistake I think I made with my girl (16 weeks now) was holding her. ALL. THE. TIME. I loved every second. We just started sleep training and it is hell. Hell going from jumping to their every cry immediately then all of a sudden not. The worst, most confusing thing for them why you don't pick them up. Im not sure this is the best path for us yet. But we are trying it out.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Make sure your little one gets outside a good amount during the day. The sun on his skin will help him establish a day/night schedule. I tried to stick to the normal wake periods during the day with naps too. Then around seven-ish in the evening, we do a bath (don’t use soap everyday, but warm water feels good), oil his skin and do a little massage, then let him play and sing a little song to him or whatever sounds good to you, and then I rock him to sleep. If he wakes up and it has been two hours or more, I fed him in a dark quiet room and rocked him back to sleep. He started to stretch out his feedings and got the hang of it. He fluctuates some one waking, but it is usually once or twice a night now. Good luck. You are doing great.

At his age (my lil guy is 10 weeks) but still can only handle being awake like an hour to and hour and a half. If he goes last that it’s much more difficult for him to get to sleep. We have followed a routine since he was about 3 weeks old. And that seems to have helped my guy (my first son I never had a routine knew nothing of wake windows and he was so much harder to get to sleep) I also have since 2 weeks old swaddled him for naps and night time sleep so when he’s ready and getting tired I swaddle him then feed him and it seems to let him know it’s time for sleep. I also have a sound machine that I do lullabies on for naps and white noise for bed time. I feel like doing bath time routine and the white noise let’s him know it’s time for sleep at night. Also right at 7 weeks my guy was still eating every 2hrs and I was given advice to just fit an extra ounce in with his feeding and it made such a difference! So that could help as well as just setting a solid routine to show sleep time from wake time.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I use the Nara app to help me track when he’s awake and asleep.

I haven’t taken the taking cara babies class but a friend told me that her approach is that it’s not our job to make the baby sleep it’s our job to provide the opportunity for sleep. So I do all 5 S’s and lay him in the bassinet or wherever I’m going to have him sleep and then I walk away for a bit and see what happens.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

For him to differentiate nap and bedtime have a bedtime routine that you do. For example ours has always been bath, lotion, read a book, breastfeed, then bed. It just kind of helps them realize that it’s bedtime after doing those certain things. Also, he could still have his days and nights mixed up. So what we always did was keep everything bright and loud during the daytime to show him that we’re up and going, then at nighttime we have everything very dark and quiet with his noise machine on!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Also, we use a sleep sack at bedtime and don’t nap where we sleep at night and i believe that’s helped.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

As for naps, I’d look into age appropriate wake windows. When babies get overtired they tend to fight sleep due to the rush of adrenaline and other things.

He has a routine more then a schedule. During the day we stay downstairs where it is bright and the tv on for noise so he can get use to it and we try to keep him in a activity during his wake windows. He goes down for contact naps and will nap sometime in his bassinet. Around 6 I start to wind down not as much play. Close blinds lower sounds so he can get ready for night. He will go completely down for the night at 8pm he will eat every 3hrs still but go back to sleep. The longest he went at night is 6hrs no bttle and that’s the longest i will allow it to go.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

We started a bedtime routine to help him decipher the difference between nap and bedtime. It also helps him sleep better at night. We do a bath (soap only once a week), lotion, pajamas and and I rock him to sleep with a bottle (we don't do that for naps-he eats when he wakes from a nap not before). Once we started doing this he dropped his first night feed and sleeps about 6 hours straight ever since! Black out curtains, sound machine, and a swaddle.
My son also eats every 2 hours during the day because he goes longer stretches at night. They still need the same amount of daily calories so they will make up for it during the day!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

564023128603170,https://facebook.com/564023128603170,563556335316516,"Your little guy might be a bit hungry, maybe up the feed amount a little and see if he goes a longer stretch but each baby is different and a 2- 3 hour stretch is about right at this stage. If he vomits a lot after upping the feed then he has probably over eaten.. babies are piggies and will sometimes just eat because it's on offer. Also see if baby is maybe confusing night time with day time. I make sure my baby's room is very dark at night and very light in the day so he knows the difference. In the morning I open the curtains and switch on a radio for some extra background noise and i speak and interact with him during feeds and nappy changes and I don't swaddle in the daytime. At night I swaddle and switch off the radio. I also don't speak or Interact with him during the night feeds and changes so he doesn't think its time to be awake and alert. I don't use a lot of light, only a small white camping light to see during nappy changes and then I have a red camping light which is less disturbing for baby which I use just so see the basics in the night. At night I feed my son in his cot, I sit him up and feed him his bottle and burp in the same position. When he was a newborn I found that the ritual of taking him out of the cot to a feeding chair and then feeding and burping left him too awake after a feed on the middle of the night which resulting in spending time trying to put him back to sleep which meant even less sleep for me. With the cot feeding I am able to feed him and lay him back down in the warmth of his cot, swaddle and leave the room. He chats to himself for a short while and then goes back to sleep. When i change his nappy In the night I do it in the middle of the feed so he has the rest of the bottle to come back to before I swaddle for sleep again. This is probably all unconventional and against the 'rules' but it's what works for me. The main thing is for you to figure out what works for you - even if it seems weird. Try different things until it works. You are doing a super job, just keep at it. Good Luck! Xx","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"
