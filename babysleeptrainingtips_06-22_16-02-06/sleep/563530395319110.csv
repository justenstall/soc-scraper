563530395319110,https://m.facebook.com/groups/babysleeptrainingtips/permalink/563530395319110/,,"My daughter is almost 10 weeks old. I know she's too young for actual sleep training. I'm just here to ask of anyone has any tips for the whole put them down ""drowsy but awake"" method? The books make it sound like you just set them down and walk away, they fuss for a minute or 2, then fall asleep. What if your kid starts to fuss, then cry, then scream? I know from a long car ride she can scream for at least an hour an 20 mins. Standing next to the bassinet, sushing, patting, none of that makes any difference.

She sleeps great once she's down, she just doesn't fall asleep independently. And I'm not sure how much more bouncing on a yoga ball my back can take.","06/20/2022, 11:06:42"
563585761980240,https://facebook.com/563585761980240,563530395319110,We started at 10 weeks. My LO is now 7 months and sleeps wonderfully. It won’t work very often in the beginning but just keep trying. I started with one nap a day and set my chair outside her room. I would go in to comfort her when crying. Sometimes it would work and sometimes I would need to rescue the nap. It was until 5 months that all naps were consistently in the crib.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563718778633605,https://facebook.com/563718778633605,563530395319110,My girl is 11 weeks. The drowsy but awake seems to work on her earlier naps but not her afternoon naps or bedtime. I think it might not work because she’s overtired later in the day.,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563758581962958,https://facebook.com/563758581962958,563530395319110,"Well, dang! You guys motivated me to give it a real try. I just put her down for a nap tired but awake. She fussed, then cried, then screamed. I stayed in there next to her patting her chest and sushing. Had no effect. I left the room, set the timer for 3 mins. She was still crying. I went in and patted her chest for 2 mins. She calmed down a little and I left. She started crying again when I left the room. I set a timer for 5 mins... she didn't make it 5 mins! She's napping on her own right now!

I think I'm going to try and do one nap a day like this till it gets easier, then start adding naps and bed time. I live in an apartment with thin walls, so I'm trying to get her used to falling asleep alone in the day time rather than keep the neighbors up late at night.

It's possible!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I can only put him down when he’s in deep sleep, otherwise when I put him drowsy but awake he will start fighting the swaddle and cry. So then I pick him up and rock him again.

563691448636338,https://facebook.com/563691448636338,563530395319110,"The drowsy but awake method didn't work for my LO when she was that little. I would hold her until she was in a deep sleep (about 20mibs) and do the arm test (if you let go of bubs arm and it drops straight down and is floppy you know they're in a deep sleep).
Now that my bub is 6 months I'm trying the drowsy but awake method by getting her used to cot. I do our usual sleep routine then put her in her cot and set a 6 min timer. Until the timer goes off she has to be in her cot but I will comfort her with my voice, patting and rocking. If she's still upset after the time is up I get her up and give her a comfort feed for a minute or two then I put her back down and reset the timer adding another minute or two that she needs to be in the cot before I get her out for a cuddle. So far doing this she has grizzled and grumbled talking to me without getting too upset and has fallen asleep in 5-20 mins.
It also helps to make sure you know bubs awake windows as when my bub was around 10-12 weeks old she started needing more stimulation and would grumble when she was bored. I used to think she needed another sleep when she actually needed to play with something else or go for a walk or sing songs or something.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Mine also settled much easier in a swaddle, but she somehow figured out how to roll to her belly at 2 weeks old. As soon as I'd set her down on her back, she'd swing her legs up, turn her head to one side, and just plop over face down 😅. But she can't figure out how to do it out of a swaddle.
She's in sleep sacks now. Maybe she's just a tummy sleeper and if I put her in face down she'd fall asleep fine on her own? Either way, she doesn't have the strength to roll back and I'd rather damage my back bouncing her on the yoga ball than risk the unthinkable.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
