I share some of these before and afters on my instgram page and thought they might be good visuals here in case you’re struggling with similar things. I can definitely help you too! It can be really tough to navigate this on your own. If we were to work together on this, I would start my doing a full in-take to see what is going on with YOUR little one. I would then use that to write a sleep plan specific to your situation and needs. This plan, as well as the follow up text support while you implement the plan, is KEY to success!

Do any of these BEFORE sides look like your situation?

Please let me know what questions or concerns you have about working with a sleep consultant? Happy to talk through it with you!

You can send me a DM and ill send you a sleep assesmemt form to fill out as a first step to working together.

EDIT: If you’re open to hiring a sleep consultant to help you meet your sleep goals with your little one please start by filling out this form and we can chat more!
