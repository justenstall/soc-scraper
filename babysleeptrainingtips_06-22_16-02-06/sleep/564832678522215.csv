I'm currently trying the Feber method but I can't take it any longer.
My baby 11weeks haven't sleep since this morning. I know she is overtired but each time I'm picking her from her crib she'll stop crying and directly groggy.
I have been in a room many time in the past two hours (first only for talking to her and after 3 times picked her up) and now it is time to feed again but she will fall asleep as soon as she will end eating.
Is there anything else working than CIO? Because she can't fight for sleeping until next feeding each time and only sleep in my arms.
The pediatrician said to let her cry but it is now 2h and she haven't stop once.
I'm afraid because as many as she is crying she is choking..
There is no sign of gas or colic.","06/22/2022, 10:32:02"
564945808510902,https://facebook.com/564945808510902,564832678522215,Sleep training before 4 months will absolutely not be successful. Right now it's all about comfort for your baby. Hold her till she falls asleep and set her down... if that wakes her up rub her little face while she is already in her bassinet or crib. Maybe a pacifier to help soothe her... but sleep training won't work at that young of an age,"06/22/2022, 15:03:19"

2 hours of crying it’s your signal that she is not ready for this.
The first 3 months are knows as the fourth trimester and you can’t spoil a baby that young.
At this age she doesn’t have the concept of self soothing and you have to help her sleep.
Of course, there will always be exceptions and babies that sleep without issue on their on, but those are not very common.
I would suggest you wait until at least 4 months.
I know that it’s recommended to start sleep training at 4-6 months, because if they are too young, babies don’t have the self soothing button.","06/22/2022, 13:03:19"

My boy got so heavy so quick so it doesn't work for us anymore. But now when he fights sleep, we get in the stroller and go on a walk. Obviously that doesn't work in the middle of the night. But babies don't know how to soothe themselves at that age. Don't let her cry. Sacrifice doing the dishes, your own sleep, anything and everything and give her comfort. Forget what our world says about them needing to sleep alone and all the time. Let them find comfort in mom's arms. And if all else fails, bring her outside and push her around in a stroller. The fresh air does wonders. Best of luck ❤️ the first like 4 months is very very hard for sleep. Just love on her as much as you can ❤️ you're doing amazing!","06/22/2022, 12:03:19"

She responded to it instantly… meaning day two and on was back to either sleeping through the night 7-6 or just one wake up.
We have a set start time for night time routine.
Then we focused on set wake up time (6am…. Yes early but four day care days she needs to be up by then). After we set the wake up time we focused on set nap time for the first nap time. We now have a child that goes down without much push back. Her body starts to learn when to produce melatonin.

I suggest focusing on set go down at night and get up.

Our schedule progressively was made over her 5 months.

You are doing great. Never stop trying something new. Every child needs something different.","06/22/2022, 13:03:19"

She will only start developing bad habits at around 4 months old. Try a comfort blanket by her face or a t-shirt that smells like you. Try lying her on her side with pillows supporting her body so she doesn't roll forward. place the blanket / t-shirt against her face and let her hold it. I've been doing that with my son since he was 6 weeks. He's 4 months now and only sleeps well with his blanket pressed to his face. I check him regularly to make sure he hasn't pushed the blanket over his nose. It's a muslin cloth, but still very cautious. Enjoy her sleeping on you and cuddling you. It will be over and you'll miss it.","06/22/2022, 13:03:20"

I don’t know if that’s an option for you but you’ll get some much needed sleep. I tried the “gentle cry it out” method checking on him every 10 minutes, rubbing his head or patting his belly/back every check without picking him up. After 2 weeks of no success with that I learned that babies get a boost of energy past 9oclock. I do “bath, book, breast, bed” I have to rock him for about 20-30 minutes and gently put him in his crib. He’s been doing good with that for 2 months and I don’t see him until the next morning. If he does wake he cries for about 5-10 minutes but I let him get comfortable and he puts himself back to sleep. The rocking will be another thing I have to break when he’s older but for now I’m happy and he’s happy.","06/22/2022, 12:03:20"

But we had to put a 12° inclined pillow. Because of the suit, and the fact that he can't really turn over, it feels safe with that pillow. This worked for us. And some days are better than others.

Since he came home with me I go to him whenever he cries, every single time. If I hear him making an upset sound I go there straight away, no matter how many times I have to go! To me, by doing this I’m reassuring my baby that mama will always be there if he’s upset and that mama will come. Since 3 months or so he’s been a delight to us! I think because I always went back to him no matter what he felt a sense of safety and security to know that he’s never going to be alone. To begin with it was extremely tedious and exhausting I’ll be honest but now He’s learnt that no matter what mama will come. I’ve watched him in the mornings and he’ll wake up 1hr before he wants to actually get up.

Je ne pense pas que vous parliez le néerlandais, alors je vais faire de mon mieux en français. Egalement une maman belge ici !

J'ai lu le livre ""sleep baby sleep"", dans lequel l'apprentissage
du sommeil commence dès l'âge de 6 semaines, bien qu'il s'agisse surtout de mettre en place des habitudes de sommeil saines. Vous faites 1 sieste le matin et 1 l'après-midi dans le berceau dans une pièce sombre, le reste des siestes pendant la journée dans un environnement léger et sonore (porte-bébé, poussette, parc,...). Pendant la journée, vous donnez à manger toutes les 3 heures et la nuit à la demande, mais en offrant suffisamment pendant la journée, votre enfant sera plus rassasié le soir et dormira mieux.

Cela fonctionne déjà pour nous et la nuit, nous avons parfois des blocs de 6 heures. Bonne chance !","06/22/2022, 14:03:21"
