Down by 7:30 and woke around 12:45 to nurse, then woke again at 4:15 to nurse. it’s 6:45 and he’s still asleep!

Two things; when did you start cutting the night feedings, and what did you all do when baby started rolling onto their bellies but then didn’t know what to do after that haha! He kinda just laid in cobra position until I went and rolled him back over.

Here’s my handsome boy 🤍","06/18/2022, 06:46:26"

He fussed a bit and then was outcold from 8pm to 6am. It was unreal. I figure if he’s doing it himself he’s totally fine! He slept the last few nights but last night woke up for a feed at 2. Because he’s sick I fed him but when he’s better I’d like to slowly wean him since I know he can do it! And my GP said he’s good to night wean,"06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

She also now rolls on her tummy and doesn’t know what to do so I just roll her back over. Ever since I put her in the Merlin sleep suit she stop waking up to eat and sleeps through the night.

My baby would moan to start with when on her tummy, she rolled back to front first so wouldn't know how to get back 😅 I just spent a bit of time helping her settle on her tummy, now she's on her side or tummy within 5 minute and stays there all night 😊","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"

Some say they need to be able to roll both ways, some say if they get there they can stay there.

Its up to you how you feel really, you can have all the advice in the world but you know your baby best.

We got from 4 to 2 ounces, then regression hit so we went back to 3, now trying 2 again 🤣 Definitely not perfect! But we’re also moving to the crib so I’m hoping he might wean himself once in there.

Ours just started rolling too! I’ve left him until he starts crying. Hoping he eventually figures out how either roll back or wants to sleep on his belly. I agree about the “wtf” look in their faces 🤣","06/18/2022, 00:00:00"
