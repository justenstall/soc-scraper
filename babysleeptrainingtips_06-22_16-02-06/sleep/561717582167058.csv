562991135373036,https://facebook.com/562991135373036,561717582167058,My 3 month old HATES being swaddled & HATES sleeping on his back unless for a nap. His bassinet is right beside my bed all night & I check on him frequently. Belly sleeping can be okay. I definitely wouldn’t suggest doing it until they are able to move their head around comfortably & can lift it up pretty high. My little guy has been holding his head up since birth so I was comfortable letting him sleep on his belly. I probably wouldn’t let him sleep on his belly in that lounger because the sides are too close to their face. You do what you’re comfortable with just know the risks. Every baby is different & not everything works the same for all of them. ❣️,"06/19/2022, 00:00:00"

Do i wake up to almost every noise he makes yes but he’s 3 months old and can hold his head up long enough to make noises for us to get him. He’s been sleeping on his stomach sine 2 months.

563686225303527,https://facebook.com/563686225303527,561717582167058,"I have to be honest with everyone. Let me introduce myself. I’m a Newborn Care Specialist, Postpartum and Infant Care Doula, a mom of 3 adult kids and grandma of 1. This has been my professional career for over 17 years.
I have a question, is it worth taking this risk knowing it can cause suffocation, God forbid you fall asleep while baby is in this position??? I can completely understand that all new parents are sleep deprived, another huge reason not to have your newborn sleep in that position as chances are you will fall asleep while “ watching” the baby sleep in safely.
I’m not here to judge but just bring AWARENESS.

My suggestion is this, watch dr Harvey Karp video on YouTube about the 5 s’s
So this and stick with it for 20 min. If baby didn’t settle, it’s probably time for a feed. Also when a baby first falls asleep they go into REM sleep, at that point you can’t put them down, they will wake up again as it’s such light sleep. Hold them until they go into non rem, which is deep, restorative sleep.

I hope my advise can help and please practice safe sleep. 💝","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I typically start around 4 weeks to teach them to go down awake but drowsy. Babies go into REM sleep first so this is the active sleep where you will see Thor eyes flutter, breathing is faster, they make all the cute faces. This is the sleep where their brain is super busy processing. During REM sleep they are easy to wake, that’s why a lot of parents struggle as they say as soon as I put baby down he wakes up again, that’s why the importance of having baby fall asleep in bassinet, crib on own with guidance from parent. I put my hand on chest and move from side to side to their head becomes like a little bobble head moving side to side, that will help, swaddle, and white noise too, pacifier if wanted, needed. It’s all called sleep conditioning, there’s no crying involved, if baby gets upset, pick up, comfort and try again.
It takes practice over and over.","06/22/2022, 00:17:52"

I would say if you are going to put him in his crib or bassinet to sleep at night , I would put him directly on the mattress instead of the snuggle me just in case he moves to the sides ☺️
