Mind you- everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you can agree to disagree with me, this is NOT me mom shaming or coming at anyone, this is coming from a place of love and support, and whether you decide to take this advice or not is totally up to you!
•Newborns usually are going to wake often. Their tummies are so small and for about the first 6 weeks, they just want to bond with you, and be reassured they have that trust and security with you.
•if you are concerned they’re waking up more than they should or can’t seem to settle after you put them back to sleep, look into reflux, gas, food sensitivities, tongue ties, or their sleep environment (temp of room, dark or too much light, white noise, what they’re sleeping in/on, etc)
•some will argue sleep training is acceptable at all ages. From things I have read, researched, and the multiple professional opinions I have gotten, sleep training is only beneficial starting as young as 4 months, when your baby is able to differentiate days and nights, connect sleep cycles, produce natural melatonin, and have an established bond with mom/dad.
•there are quite a few different sleep training methods, CIO is not your only option!! I urge y’all to Google and read up on the different methods because what works for one baby might not work for yours!
Motherhood is none the less exhausting. It brings out the best and the worst in us. Please know if you feel you are at your wits end, it is 100% okay to put baby in a safe spot and take a breather. We are only human, it’s okay to feel the emotions I’m sure all of us do and have felt.
Seriously, Google has been my best friend, the pediatrician’s office knows me on a first name basis, my mom is probably on the verge of blocking my number because I call her SO much lol, and I have probably ordered about 5 different books and read them all twice. Don’t get discouraged about posts you see, every baby is different! Mine was sleeping through the night and then in an instant I got humbled with the notorious ✨4 month sleep regression✨ it happens!! Everyone drink some water and hang in there lol","06/20/2022, 16:19:56"

All I found myself was depression, stress, anger, constant fights with my partner and lots of tears. With my second who is 7ish weeks old I also first tried the same thing and the same negative reactions happened. Now I just go with the flow and try my best to be there for both of the children. And I have slowly found some peace for my mind. Of course there are ups and downs but at the end of the day I am grateful and content.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

It was exhausting for everyone. It was making her gassy. She was exhausted and fussy during the day. Turns out she needed 5 minute of crying to put herself to sleep.

There’s tooonnnss of sleep training techniques that are baby friendly that work just as well. Our baby is 4.5 months and hit the regression a few weeks ago. Our doctor gave us advice that’s works amazing! I breastfeed and put to bed at her regular bedtime (8:30-9), then wake for a top off feed right before I go to sleep (10-10:30) and we’ve stretched out until 4-5am before needing another feed then back to sleep until 7:30am. We only wake once a night which is great, no crying required, and our hope is that she will eventually cut out the 4am wake once she no longer needs night feeds.","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

What worked best for me was splitting the night up with my husband. He was on baby duty from 9pm to 1am. I had pumped milk for him to bottle feed.

He slept through the night Sunday but here we are and he had a full diaper and a warm bottle and back to sleep. I only get this 1x so I just embrace it.

My biggest pet peeve is when ""friends"" tell me, let him cry it out or you'll spoil him by going to him when he cries. My son only cries when he needs something. I have put distance between me and those ""friends""","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

I’ve always tended to her needs if she’s upset or fussing I’m there if she needs feeding I’m there if she needs just a cuddle to help settle and to know I’m there I’ll do it” couldn’t imagine just letting her go and cry herself to sleep it would break my heart.

Luckily I don’t know if it’s because I’ve always been there she knows now and will settle so much better her naps are good she’ll settle easily and go sleep knowing I’ll be there if she needs me and at night she goes down at 7.40-6am and sleeps without waking (maybe a odd time if she wants her dummie or maybe a little food and goes right down” she’s such a good baby and I think it’s us who contribute to that. I know all babies are not the same but for my baby she always knows mummy is there and mummy will always tend to my needs if so so she’s just a settled baby now and she has been since 3 months and is gaining well so I’m not worried about her going without a bottle during the night 💓👶🏻","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

I do have to say that my baby was very sensitive to many of the gassy foods and I didn’t even realize it until she has about 8 weeks. I would absolutely recommend to anyone having a hard time with a colicky baby/baby who is having trouble sleeping to really try to change up their diets (Google foods they can cause colic!)…it’s been a game changer for me/her.

And like you said some methods might work for your baby but not for others but it’s good to share what works for you and it might help someone else. Mums/dads don’t be so hard on yourselves we’re all going through or have been through some tough times with our tiny humans but it does get easier (until they start to talk 😂 jk) you should all be proud for seeking advice no shame in it whatsoever just please don’t judge one another or tell another mum they shouldn’t be doing it that way unless it’s super unsafe of course. Let’s all just enjoy our babies they are not small for very long at all my first born will be a teenager in September and some nights she doesn’t sleep lol the newborn stages are the most stressful for sleeping as we’re use to a full nights sleep but it’s only for a short time just ride it would and let your baby BE a baby sleep schedules i think they baby makes there own on that one lol they wake up when they need something and some babies don’t even need alot of sleep you need to learn what they need could be literally anything from a tummy ache, reflux, over tired or they just simply want to be close to you. Whatever it is just stay calm take a deep breath and try something you may not have tried before even giving them a warm bath helps x","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

563891615282988,https://facebook.com/563891615282988,563679675304182,"Well said. So many parents putting unnecessary pressure on themselves to have this perfect little baby when it's all just an illusion. Babies live by their own schedule until they are past 6 months. Some baby's can follow routine but even then there are always hiccups.
I see alot of posts upset that someone else's baby sleeps all night from 3 weeks blah blah. Well every baby is different. They all have different sleep needs and some are more laid back than others.
I have 3 daughters, all raised the same with same sleep techniques
Daughter 1 woke up every 2 hours for the first 18 months. Cried alot but went to sleep well and needed lots of attention(aged 18 now and still hypo)
Daughter 2 slept through the night from 7pm to 7am from 3 weeks. Most laid back ever( now aged 14 and still the most laid back little girl ever)
Daughter 3 aged 5 weeks now. Very hard to get to sleep and requires hours of rocking, bouncing and walking the house. Wakes every 2 hours. Needs holding all day lol

It's just their personality and needs. You can read 1 million things on here and it won't change the fact your baby had their own individual needs.
Relax, follow your babies cues, embrace their personality and needs and stop trying to fit them into a text book box.
They grow up so so quick.
Take each day as it comes and don't forget that you can put them down and go to your room for a minute if you need to relax","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
