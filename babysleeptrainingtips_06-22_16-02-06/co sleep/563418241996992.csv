I have been up all night and all day yesterday with only 3 hours of sleep yesterday. So if this post is all over the place I apologize! 🥹😅 this mamas beyond exhausted.

My daughter is 1 month old since the 13th. She spent 7 days in the nicu. She was having trouble breathing on her own, she had jaundice and needed light therapy for 2 days, she had trouble eating she would eat too fast or not at all. We’d have to pace her and measure how much she’d eat to make sure she ate enough. I breastfeed and wasn’t able to latch her until the last day. I was supplementing formula until I got enough milk in and now I strickly breastfeed. She has been wanting to nurse to self soothe non stop. And since we came home from the hospital she wouldn’t sleep in her bassinet no matter how hard I tried so I gave up and co slept with her on my couch. but it’s becoming too much where I can’t do anything during the day without her crying when I put her down. I have two bassinets, her crib, and a swing and she don’t like any of them. She is just now getting to be able to sit in her swing for a few minutes but just enough for me to use the bathroom brush my teeth and sometimes she will let me make something to eat if it’s fast.
But when she starts acting colicky its usually late in the night all the way till early morning time and sometimes I’m able to get her to calm down but sometimes I can’t, even when I co sleep. I’ll check her diaper, burp her, rock her, nurse her, but she just won’t stop crying some times. Then sometimes she wants to nurse but while she’s nursing she won’t calm down so I change positions and try to make her comfortable and we will eventually get it or she’ll just fall asleep. But most of the time I can’t get her to fall asleep unless she falls asleep while nursing.
I’ve been handing it pretty okay but last night was the worst night because I tried to get her to sleep in her bassinet again and I didn’t give in. I would rock her or nurse her to sleep every time she woke up and wait around 15-20 minutes before putting her in the bassinet and every time besides once she woke up immediately. She’s been awake since 6:40 pm last night. She’s fought her sleep so bad but has fallen asleep off and on but nothing more than 30 minutes at a time.
I haven’t had any sleep, I’m not able to eat all the time, and I’m on the couch almost 24/7 because she won’t let me do anything other than hold her.
When she was in the nicu she slept in the crib there she did wake up a few times before her scheduled feedings but she was so good in there until the last day I spent all day with her and every time I’d put her in her crib she started crying and wouldn’t calm down. So now we are where we are.

What advice do you mamas have on colicky babies? What did you do to get your babies to sleep on there own?

I’m supper blessed and still just as excited for her to be here as I was the first day. And even while she’s stressing me out and screaming I’m still looking at her and smiling and laughing at how cute she is. I love her so much but I’m sooo tired and will try anything to get her to sleep in her own.

I’m going to let her sleep with me for a few hours this morning and start doing it again today since I haven’t had any sleep at all. But I don’t want to confuse her by letting her sleep with me again. But if I don’t I won’t get any sleep.

I’d appreciate any advice at all! And thank you I’m advance!","06/20/2022, 07:41:07"

You can tell by her hands, if her hands are relaxed after eating than she’s full if they’re still clenched she’s not full. Also, she could be cluster feeding and pacifying herself in you and I know it’s exhausting. My daughter is almost 6 months old and I’m her pacifier. You can also try meeting with a lactation consultant to see if she’s getting a good deep latch. My daughter not being able to latch properly is what has caused her colic. Baby wearing, and skin to skin might also help her get calm down and get some sleep. Hang in there momma, you’re doing great!","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563665248638958,https://facebook.com/563665248638958,563620575310092,"Madison Lyles I have tried gas drops but they didn’t work for her I’ve also tried gripe water and the gripe water helps with her hiccups but that’s all.
I’m pretty sure she’s getting enough to eat cause she falls asleep with her hands open when I nurse her and she’s calm at that point but when I have to burp her she gets mad and starts looking for my boob again. And like right now she’s full and asleep but wants to be sucking on my boob and if I take it out she starts crying 😢. I’ve tried giving her a pacifier once she’s fallen asleep but she won’t take any of them now she’d rather have my boob. And then when she’s on my boob freaking out even when it’s in her mouth she usually starts passing gas so I think that’s a major reason she’s fussy a lot is because of her gas. I try doing the leg exercises and they work sometimes but not all the time. And I’m the beginning she was doing a lot of cluster feedings and she still does every once in a while but here lately she’s just been using it as a pacifier. I’ve also been with a couple lactation specialist to help me get her to latch and she’s latching the same way she was when they showed me how. But I’m going to mention all of this to her pediatrician and if she can’t recommend anything to me to help I’m gonna get back with the lactation specialist again. And she hates being in the carrier when I’m trying to do stuff around the house but she crys less than if I put her down! And I’ve tried skin to skin and it does help sometimes! So thank you I’m going to try it more often! And thank you so much I’m trying 🙏🏻🥹","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Everything your saying mirrors what I have been going through for nearly 2 months. Its exhausting and nothing has helped. He is miserable all the time. I feel like a horrible mother because I havent been able to help my baby. Im sorry you are dealing with the same thing but so glad so know im not alone,"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

It helped a lot to sleep on her tummy (she could burp and release gases easily but I was giving her simethicone too) but never unattended. We could all rest and it lasted until 2 months. Now she’s 3 months old and is sleeping on her back without me around but still co-sleeping (working on transitioning to her crib). I was also freaking out about having her do like this and like that, but with time things change since they constantly change. They need you around at this age, offer her comfort for now and later she’ll be more independent. Be patient, Rome wasn’t built in a day 😊 get some rest, happy mama, happy baby","06/21/2022, 19:14:09"

Babies are just so new to the world and are just confused, so you’re their safe place. My little boy was the same way, I would have to hold him all day and co slept until 6 months old (which was my choice I could’ve stopped earlier but didn’t want to.) But he was super colicky and wanted to nurse 24/7 those first 10/11 weeks, then after that it just got so much better. Just know that you’re doing a great job and doing the best that you can right now for baby. Sometimes I would take mine outside and he would instantly stop crying it was crazy how it worked. So I would start taking him on walks everyday and it helped me so much too just getting outside and not being on the couch all day. Also, try a swaddle. My little boy loved a swaddle that used to be the only way I could lay him down when he was that little. Sending you love and prayers through this time, but just know that it does get better! ❤️","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

Our midwife recommended Nan or Qiara probiotics. She stopped crying immediately. We gave it about an hour prior to her usual crying time. It helped her a lot.

I couldn’t move that much and so she slept on me and when she’s not, she’s on my husband’s arms - i ignored all the noises that told me that it was dangerous/not recommended/
etc. i didn’t care bc I needed to rest to heal. My advice: baby wearing, and accept that some babies are just gonna need more lovin’ in their mama’s arms than others. I sometimes will wear my sling and let her sleep on me while I lay down bc I need to rest too, and the sling will just help to hold her kind of in place so I don’t drop her. Mine is just over a month old and hubby and I wear her all the time bc she will cry if she’s put down for too long (even at diaper change station). Plus I think she’s too little to be able soothe herself so you’re gonna have to help her, a lot. I just accepted that about mine and my stress level has gone down, I don’t get that much more sleep but at least I’m not as frustrated. And I’m also hoping that there is light at the end of the tunnel, just gotta keep going, do what works and what’s best for you and her, one day at a time.

And just keep on being consistent! The more you try to put her down while sleeping the longer she will stay asleep as the days pass. It's really tough but just stick with it. The first time my baby fusses she's hungry, and then she's sleepy the next time. She may also be hungry and cluster feeding I won't lie I caved and gave my baby formula to supplement because the same thing was happening with me a month in. After that first time seeing her satisfied and getting more sleep I decided to continue supplementing and I still nurse during the day. It honestly sounds alot like gas as well. Maybe try gas drops? And then it sounds like she's getting overtired as well since she shouldn't be awake very long at a time this young.","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563645438640939,https://facebook.com/563645438640939,563418241996992,"Gerber soothe drops are great!
I read that for breast feeding mamas you can put the drops on the nipple & it’ll work that way.
As far as where she sleeps, my son does okay in his swing, but the bassinet…. He’ll only stay asleep in there if I lay him on his tummy.
Of course, do what you’re comfortable with. Judge by her head control. My sons has been pretty good since day one so I’ve trusted it, I also have the owlet sock so that helps ease my anxiety a little.
Not much advice but hopefully this or something another one of these mamas said will help!

I used to have to lay her chest and arms over one thigh and just leave her Patting her back like that until she FINALLY got a burp out. It took forever sometimes. It's 100% normal.
It's exhausting...
But... its normal. I can't tell you how many times I have seen mommas asking these same questions feeling like you're the one doing something wrong. You aren't. Nothing that's happening is because of you.
I hope you can at least have some peace of mind knowing this is just kinda part of the experience.
That being said...
It may feel like your days are long and you're stuck... But... try to just rest and relax because for now you're kinda gonna be in this for a bit. Especially because it matters to you. Unless you're a heavy sleeper and you won't be able to wake if you 100% fall asleep... then... you gotta get some help from someone. (Pump... ) have someone else be the nipple for a bit :)
Nicu stays make parents paranoid (made me a super light sleeper... I wasn't before... its both great and awful at the same time...
And one thing I try to say to every momma...
These moments when they are this tiny and helpless... when the only comfort of the world that's enough is their mommas touch/voice/
warmth...
This part of their life... it is gone so fast. And even if you do savor every second of these baby snuggles and little baby noises... and them for the first time actually ""seeing"" the world around them... first smiles... all of it...
You will miss it... its precious. There were days I was exhausted and frustrated and overwhelmed and emotional... I had to remind myself of this many times. Try to be present. :)

She'll probably sleep a bit more and then it also frees up your hands so you can get something to eat at least. Hope things get better for you soon :),"06/20/2022, 00:00:00"
563507021988114,https://facebook.com/563507021988114,563418241996992,"She’s absolutely precious!! I remember those first weeks are ROUGH, it’s like I was reading my entire story. My baby was the exact same, she refused to sleep on her own from night one at the hospital and we did cosleep up until 3.5months. I was in my couch all the time, holding her at all times, I’d go pee while still holding her. It’s just hard but you’re doing amazing!
I suggest to keep cosleeping of course be careful, get a bed for her to put in your bed so she has her own safe space. She probably just wants you, she’s still freshly out the womb 🥰 that way you’ll get at least a few hours to sleep in between feds while she sleeps. Get a rolling cart caddy and have everything you need next to your bed and stay in your room with dim light or just the room dark if possible.
For colicky baby I bought gripe water and gave her as needed and also mylicon drops (I think is called) they work AMAZING! Also do massages with her legs so she can let gas out and also make sure you’re burping her, súper important.

Things will get better soon, for now just worry about having a healthy baby and for you to also be ok 😊

Picture of the little bed my husband bought for our daughter to put in our bed. She’s now 4 months and she doesn’t sleep in it anymore but we use it a lot for outdoors, so we put her in there if we are in a picnic area or if It happens to need a diaper change in the car, sometimes restaurants don’t have a family bathroom or a changing table for babies so it’s been super useful","06/20/2022, 00:00:00"

This is what took my oldest from waking up 2-3 times a night to sleeping through the entire night, every night.

1. A “dessert” bottle before bed, basically just an extra ounce or so of food to get him milk drunk and sleep longer 2. A weighted sleep sack. We’re using the nested bean. It’s supposed to feel as if they have moms hand on them 3. Gripe water 4. Gas drops after feeds 5. Probiotics for baby 6. Digestive enzymes for mama if breastfeeding 7. White noise machine 8. Keeping him upright 30min after feeds 9. Elevating a side of the bassinet (we rolled a towel up under one side).

Baby sleeps better with dad at night and I’m still trying to deal with day time naps-I just got a waste band with heat pack for him and it seems to help when he has gasses. Good job reaching out and your not alone In this struggle…..but I had to hire a night doula a couple times a week and a babysitter during the day to get any sleep. Then I had to take baby and me to stay with his dad. But it’s still a challenge 10 weeks in-but he is sleeping better at night now. Do what you have to to protect your mental health-these postpartum days are so hard emotionally. I wish I had some answers for you but I just wanted to say that I use a crib wedge and when he was co sleeping I used a firm change pad elevated slightly at the head with rolled up receiving blankets on either side tucked snuggled away from his face.

Take her for a nice walk even if it’s twice a day try and get her to sleep for abit once baba is struggling with colic and is up for hours they tend to get really over tired and it’s always hard to settle on top of everything else & dentanox & gripe water (I dip her dummie in it instead of putting a teaspoon in her mouth she ends up spitting it out) is good if she’s crying she’ll be sucking in a lot of air and no doubt will have a lot of wind make sure you wind.

I have an 8 week old who is on and off colicky, and she was quite bad the past few days that I eventually had to call backup (sister in law) to hold her while I showered, cooked and had a 2hr nap because I was crying out of exhaustion. It's tough when the little one won't let you put them down... my advice would be to swaddle her (if you don't already) straight after she feeds and then hold her until she's asleep. Then when transferring her to her bassinet, slowly put her down and keep holding her even when her body is on the mattress by leaning over. Once the mattress warms up a little slowly move your hands out. This seems to work on my baby. The process takes me about 10min but she has been able to stay asleep, and has recently started sleeping 5-6hrs on her own. As I said earlier, it does get better.

Our second night in the hospital, during a 4.5 hour breast feeding session, our little one screamed like I’ve never heard her scream still to this day. Like she was in pain. Every time I’d pull her off the boob a couple seconds later she was wailing. I finally called in a nurse after 4.5 hours of trying to breast feed her and asked for some formula. We gave her a little bit and she immediately fell asleep and was asleep for a couple hours. I got home and started pumping and tried EVERYTHING that’s recommended for breast milk supply and I just have never had enough supply to fully feed her. So we were supplementing with formula. Now we’re basically just all formula. But it could totally be why your little one is fussing all the time.

I started pumping again yesterday and I was getting more milk than I thought I would with her nursing as much as she does. My boobs also leak ALOT 🥴. But I try to keep lactation snacks near me on the couch and I drink a lot of body armor drinks so maybe it helps what mlst the food I do eat is food that is known to help boost milk supply.

We also started swaddling him with Velcro swaddles at night. He cries sometimes when we initially put him in it, but we rock him to sleep in it in our arms then transfer him to his cot. They say they love this because it makes them feel secure! Have you tried this?","06/21/2022, 00:00:00"

The more upright they are the less air intake while nursing there is. Also there is a hold that is great for colicy babies it’s holding them cross cradle but their body is facing out . As for sleeping in the bassinet make sure the mattress is warm before placing her down so either warm it up with your hand , place a Luke warm hot water bottle on it then remove before lying babe down. Also placing a t shirt you wore the day before or the one you wore in the morning around the mattress tucking in any loose bits so it has your sent on it.

Gas drops and gripe water. 4. Tummy time. 5. Watch what you eat when breastfeeding, (my girl doesn’t tolerate when I have certain things like cheese or peanutbutter.) 6. White noise!

When he has colic moment I give him Colic Calm (you can only give up to 4 doses in 24hrs) he has immediate release. Also after each feed ( head higher than body) I burp him as much as I can and hold him upright for 30 min. And then put him in the tummy few times a day, as massage and bicycle.

FTM as well with 3 month old who was very gassy the first month and a half until he learned to poop on his own (then we switched him to formula and we’re learning things all over again). My LO was exactly the same, he would self soothe on the boob whenever he hd to poop so that the milk pushed down whatever was inside and he would overeat then puke. Add to that the all night grunting etc. No advice on that end except for the biogaia drops which helped him pass stools easier and the colic gripe water which now helps soothe him from gassy formula. For cosleeping, we also did the same until about 7 weeks. Had him in the Snuggle Me between us in a king bed and had the Nanit camera on for monitoring vitals. He hated the bassinet, the snoo, the bouncer etc. He loves his crib though. Some babies just do better with the transitioning to the crib directly. We have his crib in our room and sleep better now. And as for the swing, babies are different. They adjust slowly. Our LO just recently started playing in his bouncer at 2 months because before that he could barely recognize the objects and wanted to feel safe on mommy or daddy. Sorry I can’t provide solid advice but it does pass. The world is so new for them. Just forget about house looking perfect and clean, and if you have financial means order out for another month or so during the week or get your spouse to help out. We had to hire a cleaner and my spouse cooks so that’s how we managed. I was the same way, couldn’t even shower most days.

Second, I would have her checked for reflux. It often shows up just like this in babies. If you can, use a pacifier. The sucking helps produce saliva that cools the burning.

Definitely a tight tight swaddle will help but I wouldn't look at any sleep training with a colic (or reflux) baby. It's to much to ask of them. My guy got better as soon as he was rolling (circa 5 months).

You get them nice and ready for sleep. And lay them down in bed. Then try and leave, as sometimes you have to stay at bedside.
When they cry you pick up. And sooth and calm and lay back down.
And again
And again.
If doesn't cry with you at bed side -\-\ Take a step away.
And another.
When get to pt of baby crying. Pick up. Soothe. Lay down. Take steps and stay.
Talk to babe once getting fussy. Mommy's right here. Your safe. It's time to sleep. Mom will be here when you wake up. Or I'm staying home. You sleep. Idk something. And just keep it up. Maybe this will go on for hours and for a few days. Every sleep time. Every nap. Every bedtime. Every day. All day. For a few days to a week!

Idk on the colicky thing. Um, does she do best when she's ""sitting"" up or like laying kinda up? If it's colic that's like gas, upset stomach, ect. Right? After eating with reflux some have better time keeping them sitting up for a while.
Rub tummy. Try and Xtra burp. Of course gas drops and gripe water. And make sure doesn't need to poo, doing bicycle legs and bring knees up to chest pausing there, and then pull legs all the way out and pause. So tht slowly. Um. Warmth on the belly. Warm baths. Massaging belly.

I intended on exclusively breastfeeding with some pumping so that my husband could give a bottle and bond with baby. My milk never really came in. I'm still only producing a half ounce to an ounce every 2-3 hours/feeding. We supplement with 3 ounces of formula. Until we figured that out my son would cry and be inconsolable. I would pump a few times when someone else can hold the baby just to see how much you're actually producing. My son wants to be held 24/7. We tried swaddling but he was like Houdini and would always escape. He wanted to have his arms out and be free to move. Once he was 8 lbs (he was born at 7lbs 2oz but then lost weight while we figured out I wasn't producing enough) we got a Dreamland weighted sleep sack. The pediatrician also recommended putting a folded towel under his mattress to help with reflux and Mylicon for gas. Now he sleeps 5-6 hours straight in his bassinet. Naps are another story. We don't use the sleepsack for naps because I don't want to confuse his days and nights and undo the progress we've made with night time sleep. If he falls asleep anywhere other than someone's arms (bassinet, carseat, swing, Momaroo) for a nap, he will sleep a max of 30 min. If he falls asleep in your arms and you try to put him down, he wakes up immediately or within a few minutes. He fights sleep so for now I'm still holding him. He tends to sleep longer and deeper when I do. I think the fact that I have to hold him all the time definitely affected my supply. I don't have a chance to eat or drink the way I should or pump for that matter. I didn't want to drink too much because then I'd have to pee and wake up my son or try to hold it until he woke up from his nap (up to 2 hours) and be uncomfortable. When my husband went back to work, I try to keep snacks available that I can eat with one hand - sippable soup, trail mix, granola, granola bars, string cheese, baby carrots, yogurt tubes, Pop Tarts. When he wakes up from a nap, he is usually hungry. I put him in the bassinet for a minute, use the bathroom, get his bottle and my snack and/or drink, change him, feed him, and then eat while he is doing something I don't need to hold him for (playmat, swing, Momaroo or during a drive/walk).

I didn’t force her to sleep by herself if she didn’t want to.
Most of the day naps we would contact sleep.

At 5 months I started sleep training her and now she sleeps by herself in the crib.

Still wakes up for night feedings.

Sucking soothes babies and then have that need. What would I do I would take my nipple out of her mouth and replace it with pacifier. But it’s not good for their sleep later on.
Now she sleeps without pacifier or boob.
